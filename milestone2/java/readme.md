
To reproduce the experiment:


```
python step1_gen_tests.py

python step2_analyze.py

python step3_paraphrase.py
```

result of chatgpt generation codes:

Successful compilation count: 16.
Failed compilation count: 34.
Successful compilation rate: 32.00%.
Total test pass rate after successful compilation: 68.89%.
The semantic equivalent code generated by chatgpt can also pass the tests.


Some of the recordings when chatgpt made a successful test generations and equivalent codes: 


['4', '6', '7', '13', '14', '18', '19', '28', '30', '31', '33', '36', '38', '39', '45', '49']
