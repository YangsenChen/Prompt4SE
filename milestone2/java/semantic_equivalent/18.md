There are different ways to produce semantically equivalent code for the `dot` function. Here's one example that has the same functionality:

```java
public double dot(MAVector v) {

    double sum = 0.0;
    int n = Math.min(nelems, v.getNelems());

    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
      sum += elements[k] * v.elements[k];
    }

    return sum;
}
```

In this implementation, the check for vector length equality and the exception throwing have been removed. Instead, the `Math.min` function is used to determine the number of elements to iterate over, which is the smallest of the two vector lengths. The product of corresponding elements in both vectors is added to the running total inside the loop. The result is then returned as the dot product of the two input vectors.
