Here's an alternative implementation for the `indexRows()` method that's semantically equivalent to the original code:

```
private int indexRows(long geoPackageId, FeatureCursor cursor) {
    int count = 0;

    if (cursor == null) {
        throw new NullPointerException("Cursor cannot be null");
    }

    try {
        while ((progress == null || progress.isActive()) && cursor.moveToNext()) {
            try {
                FeatureRow row = cursor.getRow();
                if (row.isValid()) {
                    boolean indexed = index(geoPackageId, row, false);
                    if (indexed) {
                        count++;
                    }
                    if (progress != null) {
                        progress.addProgress(1);
                    }
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                Log.e(FeatureIndexer.class.getSimpleName(), 
                      "Failed to index feature. Table: " + featureDao.getTableName() + 
                      ", Position: " + cursor.getPosition(), e);
            }
        }
    } finally {
        cursor.close();
    }

    return count;
}
```

This implementation replaces the initial `count = -1` with `count = 0`. It also performs a null check on the `cursor` parameter and throws an exception if it is null. Inside the loop, it removes the `if (count < 0)` check and initializes `count` to `0`. Finally, it returns `count` directly instead of subtracting 1 from it. Other than these changes, the functionality of the method is the same: it iterates over the cursor, attempts to index each feature row, and returns the total number of feature rows that were successfully indexed.
