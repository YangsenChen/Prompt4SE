Here's a semantically equivalent version of the `externalize()` method provided previously:

```java
public void externalize(DataOutputStream sink) throws IOException {
        arrayVar.externalize(sink);

        for (Map.Entry<String, ClientIO> entry : mapVars.entrySet()) {
            ClientIO bt = entry.getValue();
            bt.externalize(sink);
        }
    }
```

This version still first calls the `arrayVar.externalize(sink)` method to serialize the `arrayVar` object's data to the specified `DataOutputStream` object.

Then instead of using an `Enumeration` to iterate through the `mapVars` collection elements, this version slightly change the code to iterate through the map using a `for loop` iterating over the `entrySet()` of the map and getting the value object and calling its `externalize()` method directly.

Finally, the `bt` variables is used to store the value of each element, which is then used to call the `externalize()` method, similarly as before.

This version of the code performs the same functionality as the original code, but it uses a more modern way of iterating through the `mapVars` collection using `Map.Entry` and `entrySet()`. Additionally, the `Enumeration` type is replaced with a more object-oriented approach, making the code more readable to accommodate newer Java versions.
