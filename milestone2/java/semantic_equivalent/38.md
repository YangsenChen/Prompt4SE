Here is semantically equivalent code for `log` method, which should behave exactly the same as the original implementation:

```java
private static String log(String message, Object... args) {
    String formattedMessage = String.format(message, args);
    Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(Server.class.getCanonicalName());
    logger.log(Level.SEVERE, formattedMessage);
    return formattedMessage;
}
```

In this version, we changed the name of `message` to `formattedMessage` to better reflect what the variable is doing, without altering any of its original behavior. We also split up the two method calls on separate lines to improve readability. Finally, we removed the use of the fully-qualified class name (`java.util.logging`) by importing the `Logger` and `Level` classes directly.
