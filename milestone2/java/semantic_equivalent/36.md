One possible semantically equivalent code for the `removeDups` method that also improves the time complexity to O(n) is:

```java
public static List<Property> removeDups(List<Property> org) {
    Set<Property> set = new LinkedHashSet<>(org);
    return new ArrayList<>(set);
}
```

This code works similarly by taking a `List` of `Property` objects and returns the new list containing only the unique elements while preserving their original order. Instead of iterating through the `List` and checking whether each element already exists in the `result` list, this code converts the `List` to a `Set` of `Property` objects using the `LinkedHashSet`, which preserves the insertion order. Because a `Set` can only contain unique elements, any duplicates in the original list are removed automatically. Finally, the code converts the resulting `Set` back to a new `List` of `Property` objects and returns it. This approach has a better time complexity of O(n) because `Set` lookup has a time complexity of O(1) instead of O(n) for `List`.
