One possible equivalent code for the `sendMessage` method is:

```java
public static Future<Boolean> sendMessage(final Email msg) {
  if (asynchronousSend) {
    return executor.submit(() -> {
      try {
        msg.setSentDate(new Date());
        msg.send();
        return true;
      } catch (Throwable e) {
        MailException me = new MailException("Error while sending email", e);
        logger.error("The email has not been sent", me);
        return false;
      }
    });
  } else {
    try {
        msg.setSentDate(new Date());
        msg.send();
        return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(true);
    } catch (Throwable e) {
        MailException me = new MailException("Error while sending email", e);
        logger.error("The email has not been sent", me);
        return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(false);
    }
  }
}
```

The code uses lambda expressions and the `CompletableFuture` class to provide a more concise and modern implementation of the same functionality as the original code. The behavior is the same, the method sends an email message and returns a `Future<Boolean>` object representing the result.

In the asynchronous case, the method submits a lambda expression to the `ExecutorService` that sends the email and returns a `Boolean` value representing the success or failure of the process. If an exception is thrown while sending the email, a `MailException` is caught, logged, and returns `false`.

In the synchronous case, the method attempts to send the email message and uses `CompletableFuture.completedFuture()` to wrap a `Boolean` value representing the success or failure of the process in a completed `Future<Boolean>` object. If an exception is thrown while sending the email, a `MailException` is caught, logged, and returns a completed `Future<Boolean>` object representing `false`.

Note that this code requires Java 8 or higher to execute properly.
