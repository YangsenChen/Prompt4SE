Here is one possible alternative implementation of the `hasActivityAndNotEndOfStream` method that is semantically equivalent to the original implementation:

```java
boolean hasActivityAndNotEndOfStream(final long nowNs) {
    boolean isActive = true;

    boolean hasExpired = (lastPacketTimestampNs + imageLivenessTimeoutNs) - nowNs < 0;
    boolean isPastHwm = rebuildPosition.getVolatile() >= hwmPosition.get();

    if (hasExpired || (isEndOfStream && isPastHwm)) {
        isActive = false;
    }

    return isActive;
}
```

In this implementation, the code inside the `if` statement is unchanged, but the conditions are expressed as separate boolean variables `hasExpired` and `isPastHwm`. These variables should produce the same result as the original conditions, but they make the code more readable by giving meaningful names to the logical conditions.
