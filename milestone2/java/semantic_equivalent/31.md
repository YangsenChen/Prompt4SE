Here's an alternative version of the `failAfter` method that provides the same functionality as the original code:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public static <T> CompletableFuture<T> failAfter(final long duration) {
    CompletableFuture<T> promise = new CompletableFuture<>();
    ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();
    ScheduledFuture<Void> timeout = scheduler.schedule(() -> {
        promise.completeExceptionally(new TimeoutException("Timeout after " + duration));
        return null;
    }, duration, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
    promise.whenComplete((result, error) -> timeout.cancel(false));
    scheduler.shutdown();
    return promise;
}
```

In this code, we create a new `ScheduledExecutorService` object to schedule a task that completes the `CompletableFuture` exceptionally after the given duration. We then use a `ScheduledFuture` object to keep a reference to the scheduled task and cancel it if the original `CompletableFuture` completes before the timeout. Finally, we `shutdown` and release the resources of the scheduler service. The resulting code provides the same timeout functionality as the original code, with a minor difference in how the `ScheduledExecutorService` is created and used.
