The `@Override` annotation is used in Java to indicate that a method declaration is intended to override a method declaration in a superclass or interface. By using this annotation, the Java compiler will check if the method signature matches the signature of a method in the superclass/interface at compile-time.

In this case, the `toObject()` method is likely overriding a method in an interface, so it is important to use the `@Override` annotation to ensure correctness.

Here is the equivalent code that includes the `@Override` annotation:

```java
@Override
public Feed toObject() throws JAXBException {
    this.upgradeToLatestVersion();
    return (Feed) ImmobiliareItUtils.createUnmarshaller().unmarshal(this.getDocument());
}
```

Note that the `@Override` annotation cannot be removed or substituted with any other annotation without changing the behavior of the code.
