If we want to produce semantically equivalent code for the given `createView()` method, we could write a new method with the same functionality but using slightly different syntax. Here's one possible implementation:

```java
protected Array createView(Index index) {
    ArrayObject ao = new ArrayObject();
    return ao.factory(dataType, elementType, isVlen, index, storage);
}
```

In this implementation, instead of calling `ArrayObject.factory()` directly, we create a new instance of `ArrayObject` and then call the `factory()` method on that instance. This should have the same effect as the original implementation, but the code is structured slightly differently.

Note that this implementation assumes that `dataType`, `elementType`, `isVlen`, and `storage` are instance variables defined elsewhere in the class. If they are not, they will need to be passed in as parameters to the method or otherwise initialized before the method can be called.
