One possible semantically equivalent implementation of the `draw` method in Java could look like:

```java
public void draw(Graphics2D g, AffineTransform pixelAT) {
    // Set the rendering properties of the Graphics2D object
    g.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING, RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_OFF);
    g.setStroke(new BasicStroke(0.0f));
  
  	// Get the current clip bounds for the Graphics2D object
    Rectangle2D clipRect = g.getClipBounds();
  
    // Set the color of the Graphics2D object
    g.setColor(color);
  
   	// Get the shapes to draw
    List<Shape> shapes = getShapes(g, pixelAT);
  
    // Draw each shape that lies within the clip bounds of the Graphics2D object
    for (Shape shape : shapes) {
        if (shape.intersects(clipRect)) {
            g.draw(shape);
        }
    }
}
```

Note that this implementation performs similar operations to the original code, but with slightly different syntax and method calls:

1. Sets the rendering properties using `setRenderingHint()` and `setStroke()`.
2. Gets the clip bounds using `getClipBounds()` instead of casting the return value of `getClip()`.
3. Sets the color of the Graphics2D object before drawing shapes.
4. Uses a for-each loop to iterate over the shapes to draw instead of an explicit `Iterator`.
5. Checks for shape-clipping using `shape.intersects()` instead of `shapeBounds.intersects()`.

In summary, these changes can make the code more readable or easier to maintain, but they do not alter the behavior of the original code.
