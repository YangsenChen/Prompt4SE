The `@Override` annotation is used in Java to indicate that a method in a subclass is meant to override a method with the same signature in its parent class. Semantically equivalent code can be written without using the `@Override` annotation, like this:

```java
protected void doRow(FitRow row) throws Exception {
    currentCellParameter = FitUtils.extractCellParameter(row.cells().get(0));
    this.row = row;
    super.doRow(row);
}
```

The functionality of the code remains the same whether or not the `@Override` annotation is present, but using it provides documentation that the method is intended to override the parent class's method.
