Here is an alternative implementation for the `int3` method that is semantically equivalent to the original implementation:

```java
public static int int3(RandomAccessFile raf) throws IOException {
    byte[] bytes = new byte[3];
    raf.readFully(bytes);
    int a = bytes[0] & 0xFF; //Convert byte to unsigned int
    int b = bytes[1] & 0xFF;
    int c = bytes[2] & 0xFF;

    return int3(a, b, c);
}
```

This implementation also reads three bytes from the `RandomAccessFile` object using the `readFully` method which reads the full array of bytes before returning, as opposed to reading one byte at a time. It then converts each byte to an unsigned integer by using a bitwise AND operation with `0xFF`. Finally, it uses the `int3(a, b, c)` method to concatenate the three integers into a single integer and returns it.

This implementation is semantically equivalent to the original implementation and produces the same result. The main difference is that it reads all three bytes at once, which can potentially be more efficient than reading one byte at a time, especially in cases where the `RandomAccessFile` object is associated with a slow I/O device.
