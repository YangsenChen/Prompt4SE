Here's a semantically equivalent code for the `createLog()` method using the `computeIfAbsent()` method introduced in Java 8 for `Map` objects:

```java
private Logger createLog() {
    Class<?> clazz = getClass();
    return loggers.computeIfAbsent(clazz, Logger::getLogger);
}
```
The `computeIfAbsent()` method is used to retrieve the logger instance for the class from the `loggers` `Map`. If an instance is not present, it will create a new one using `Logger.getLogger()` method and add it to the map before returning the instance. This code is semantically equivalent to the original implementation while reducing the amount of boilerplate code.
