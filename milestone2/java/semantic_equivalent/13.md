The `@Override` annotation indicates that a method declaration is intended to override a method with the same signature in a superclass or interface. If there is no superclass or interface method with the same signature, using `@Override` will cause a compilation error.

If the `write()` method does indeed override another method, the `@Override` annotation should be used.

Here is the semantically equivalent code without the `@Override` annotation:

```java
public void write(HttpServletResponse httpResponse, Object value) throws IOException {
    ((StreamHandler<?>) value).invokeHandler(httpResponse.getOutputStream());
}
```

This code declares a method named `write()` with the same signature as the overridden method, and it provides an implementation. If the method declaration does not match an existing superclass or interface method, it simply declares a new method.

However, if there is an existing superclass or interface method with the same signature as this method, it is considered good practice to use the `@Override` annotation to indicate that the method is intended to override the superclass or interface method.
