Here's an updated implementation of the `init()` method that is semantically equivalent to the original implementation:

```java
static public void init(Application app, String applicationName, String clientApiKey, boolean enableAutoTracking, boolean enableAppLifecycleEvents, Analytics.DeviceEvent... contexts) {
    // Delegate to the new init() method with additional parameters
    Analytics.init(app, applicationName, clientApiKey, enableAutoTracking, enableAppLifecycleEvents, contexts);
}
```

This implementation delegates to the new `init()` method of the `Analytics` module with additional boolean parameters for configuring auto tracking and app lifecycle events.

This updated implementation provides an alternative to the deprecated method with additional configuration options, which can be used as a replacement. By doing this, the deprecated method can safely be removed without breaking any existing code that still depends on it.
