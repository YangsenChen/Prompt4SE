Here is the semantically equivalent code for `getAnnotationAnywhere`:

```java
public <A extends Annotation> A getAnnotationAnywhere(Class<A> annotationType) {
        A anno = getAnnotation(annotationType);

        if (anno != null) {
            return anno;
        }

        Class<?> clazz = (Class<?>) GenericTypeReflector.erase(type);
        anno = clazz.getAnnotation(annotationType);

        return anno;
}
```

This code is equivalent to the original code because it executes the same series of instructions. However, it is structured differently. In this code, the first `if` statement checks whether an annotation already exists and returns it immediately if it does. Then, the code retrieves the annotation from the class if it was not found via `getAnnotation`. Finally, the method returns the last value of `anno`, which will either be the annotation instance returned by `getAnnotation` or the one returned by `clazz.getAnnotation`.
