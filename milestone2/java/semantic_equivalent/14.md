Here's an alternative implementation of the `forInt` method that is semantically equivalent to the original implementation:

```java
public static Profile forInt(int i) {
    if (i > 0 && i <= ALL.length) {
        return ALL[i - 1];
    } else {
        return UNKNOWN;
    }
}
```

This implementation eliminates the need for the `p` variable, since the `return` statement returns the selected `Profile` directly. The `if` statement has been modified slightly, but it performs the same check to determine whether the input is valid. 

If the input is valid, then the method returns the `Profile` object at the appropriate index, otherwise it returns the `UNKNOWN` object.
