Here's an alternative version of the code:

```
@Override
public Immoxml toObject() throws JAXBException {
    upgradeToLatestVersion();
    return (Immoxml) ImmoXmlUtils.createUnmarshaller()
                .unmarshal(getDocument());
}
```

This version is semantically equivalent to the original code block.
