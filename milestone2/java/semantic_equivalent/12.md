Here is an equivalent implementation of the `adjustPen()` function that maintains the same functionality, but looks different:

```java
private static void adjustPen() {
    double currentPenWidth = Tortoise.getPenWidth();
    double newPenWidth = currentPenWidth + 1.0;

    // Change the pen color to the next color on the color wheel
    Color nextColor = ColorWheel.getNextColor();
    Tortoise.setPenColor(nextColor);

    // Set the new pen width
    Tortoise.setPenWidth(newPenWidth);

    // Reset the pen width to 1 if it is greater than 4
    if (newPenWidth > 4.0) {
        Tortoise.setPenWidth(1.0);
    }
}
```

In this implementation, we first get the current pen width using `Tortoise.getPenWidth()` and store it in a new variable named `currentPenWidth`. Then, we calculate the new pen width by adding 1.0 to the current pen width and store it in a new variable named `newPenWidth`. After that, we change the pen color to the next color on the color wheel using `ColorWheel.getNextColor()` and set the pen color using `Tortoise.setPenColor()`. Next, we set the new pen width using `Tortoise.setPenWidth()`. Finally, we check if the new pen width is greater than 4.0 and if so, we reset the pen width to 1.0 using `Tortoise.setPenWidth()`. This implementation maintains the same functionality as the original implementation, while using different variable names and a slightly different structure.
