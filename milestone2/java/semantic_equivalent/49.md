Here's an equivalent code for the function public int peakNextBits(int n) throws IOException: 

```
public int peakNextBits(int n) throws IOException {
        if (n > 8) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("N must be less than or equal to 8.");
        }
        if (nBit == 8) {
            advance();
            if (curByte == -1) {
                return -1;
            }
        }

        int[] bits = new int[16 - nBit];
        int cnt = 0;

        for(int i = nBit; i < 8 ; i++){
            bits[cnt++] = (curByte >> (7 - i)) & 0x1;
        }

        for(int i = 0 ; i < 8 ; i++){
            advance();
            if(curByte == -1){
                return -1;
            }
            bits[cnt++] = (curByte >> (7 - i)) & 0x1;
        }

        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){
            result <<= 1;
            result |= bits[i];
        }

        return result;
    }
```

This code does the same calculations as the original and raises an IllegalArgumentException if n is greater than 8. The main differences are in the for loop that gets the bits, which now uses advance() function to get the next byte from the input stream and add those to the bits array. The for-loop that generates the result was left unchanged, as it accurately parses the n bits.
