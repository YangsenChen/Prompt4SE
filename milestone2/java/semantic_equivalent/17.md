One way to produce semantically equivalent code to the `updateLastIndexed()` method would be to use a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that might be thrown by the `updateLastIndexed()` method:

``` java
public boolean updateLastIndexed(TableMetadata metadata, long lastIndexed) {
    try {
        boolean updated = updateLastIndexed(metadata.getGeoPackageId(), metadata.getTableName(), lastIndexed);
        metadata.setLastIndexed(lastIndexed);
        return updated;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

In this code, the `updateLastIndexed()` method is wrapped in a `try` block, and the `metadata` object's `lastIndexed` field is always updated regardless of whether or not the update operation is successful. If an exception is thrown, the method catches it and returns `false`, indicating that the update failed.

Note that the `catch` block in this code is catching all exceptions, which may not be desirable in a real-world application. A more specific exception type could be caught if the `updateLastIndexed()` method throws a specific type of exception. Additionally, if it's desirable to perform any additional clean-up or logging operations when an exception occurs, those operations could be included in the `catch` block.
