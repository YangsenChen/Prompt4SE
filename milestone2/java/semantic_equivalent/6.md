The following code is semantically equivalent to the original code snippet:

```java
public static ThreadFactory daemonThreadFactory(final String name, final int priority) {
    AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();

    return r -> {
        Thread thread = new Thread(r);
        thread.setName(name + "-" + count.incrementAndGet());
        thread.setDaemon(true);
        thread.setPriority(priority);

        return thread;
    };
}
```

This version of the code uses a lambda expression instead of an anonymous inner class for implementing the `newThread` method of the `ThreadFactory` interface. It also declares the `count` variable outside of the lambda. 

Note that functionally, both versions of the code are equivalent - the lambda expression is just a shorter and more concise way to write the same code.
