Create a model that can generate semantically equivalent Python code for any given input. The generated code should meet the requirement of having the exact same output when given the same input.

The generated code should not import any external libraries that are not used in the original code. There are no constraints on the length or complexity of the generated code, correctness is the most important factor. If possible, the generated code should be shorter and less complex than the original code.

Here's the code I want you to generate about:
    ```python
    def _is_iterable(item):
    """ Checks if an item is iterable (list, tuple, generator), but not string """
    return isinstance(item, collections.Iterable) and not isinstance(item, six.string_types)
    ```

Here's the generated code that meets the given requirements:

```python
def _is_iterable(item):
    """ Checks if an item is iterable (list, tuple, generator), but not string """
    try:
        iter(item)
        return not isinstance(item, str)
    except TypeError:
        return False
```

This code checks whether an item is iterable or not (excluding strings) in the same way as the original code. The main difference is the use of a try-except block to check iterability, which is more concise and efficient than the original code's use of `isinstance()` and module imports. This code also avoids the use of external libraries and should produce the same output as the original code when given the same input.
