Now with the following code
    ```python
    def __jaccard(int_a, int_b):  # pragma: no cover
    '''Jaccard similarity between two intervals

    Parameters
    ----------
    int_a, int_b : np.ndarrays, shape=(2,)

    Returns
    -------
    Jaccard similarity between intervals
    '''
    ends = [int_a[1], int_b[1]]
    if ends[1] < ends[0]:
        ends.reverse()

    starts = [int_a[0], int_b[0]]
    if starts[1] < starts[0]:
        starts.reverse()

    intersection = ends[0] - starts[1]
    if intersection < 0:
        intersection = 0.

    union = ends[1] - starts[0]

    if union > 0:
        return intersection / union

    return 0.0
    ```
    Can you generate another code that is different from this one, but produces the same output given the same input?

## chatgpt: 

Certainly! Here's one possible alternative code that should produce the same output as the original `__jaccard` function:

```python
def __jaccard(int_a, int_b):
    '''Jaccard similarity between two intervals

    Parameters
    ----------
    int_a, int_b : np.ndarrays, shape=(2,)

    Returns
    -------
    Jaccard similarity between intervals
    '''
    a_len = int_a[1] - int_a[0]
    b_len = int_b[1] - int_b[0]
    intersection = max(min(int_a[1], int_b[1]) - max(int_a[0], int_b[0]), 0)
    union = a_len + b_len - intersection
    
    if union > 0:
        return intersection / union
    
    return 0.0
```

This code computes the Jaccard similarity between `int_a` and `int_b` using similar logic, but with some differences in how it computes the intersection and union. Instead of calculating endpoints and reversing lists, it uses the lengths of the intervals and calculates the overlap directly. This should produce the same output as the original code for any input intervals.
