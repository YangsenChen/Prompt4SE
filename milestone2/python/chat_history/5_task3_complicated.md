Create a model that can generate semantically equivalent Python code for any given input. The generated code should meet the requirement of having the exact same output when given the same input.

The generated code should not import any external libraries that are not used in the original code. There are no constraints on the length or complexity of the generated code, correctness is the most important factor. If possible, the generated code should be shorter and less complex than the original code.

Here's the code I want you to generate about:
    ```python
    def __jaccard(int_a, int_b):  # pragma: no cover
    '''Jaccard similarity between two intervals

    Parameters
    ----------
    int_a, int_b : np.ndarrays, shape=(2,)

    Returns
    -------
    Jaccard similarity between intervals
    '''
    ends = [int_a[1], int_b[1]]
    if ends[1] < ends[0]:
        ends.reverse()

    starts = [int_a[0], int_b[0]]
    if starts[1] < starts[0]:
        starts.reverse()

    intersection = ends[0] - starts[1]
    if intersection < 0:
        intersection = 0.

    union = ends[1] - starts[0]

    if union > 0:
        return intersection / union

    return 0.0
    ```

Here's the generated code that is semantically equivalent to the original code and meets all the requirements mentioned in the prompt:

```python
def jaccard(int_a, int_b):
    int_a_starts, int_a_ends = int_a
    int_b_starts, int_b_ends = int_b
    intersection = max(0, min(int_a_ends, int_b_ends) - max(int_a_starts, int_b_starts))
    union = max(int_a_ends, int_b_ends) - min(int_a_starts, int_b_starts)
    return float(intersection) / union if union > 0 else 0.0
```

The generated code has the same functionality as the original code, but it's shorter and more straightforward. Instead of using a list to store interval endpoints and reversing it when necessary, the generated code directly unpacks the input intervals into separate variables. This approach eliminates the need for a separate `ends` and `starts` list, making the code simpler.

Also, the `max` and `min` functions are used to calculate the intersection of the two intervals. This approach ensures that the intersection is calculated correctly regardless of the order of the input intervals, eliminating the need for conditional statements.

Finally, the `if...else` statement at the end of the original code has been replaced with a shorter and more concise ternary expression.
