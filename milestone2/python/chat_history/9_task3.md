Now with the following code
    ```python
    def is_likely_benign(bs_terms, bp_terms):
    """Check if criterias for Likely Benign are fullfilled

    The following are descriptions of Likely Benign clasification from ACMG paper:

    Likely Benign
      (i) 1 Strong (BS1每BS4) and 1 supporting (BP1每 BP7) OR
      (ii) ≡2 Supporting (BP1每BP7)

    Args:
        bs_terms(list(str)): Terms that indicate strong evidence for benign variant
        bp_terms(list(str)): Terms that indicate supporting evidence for benign variant

    Returns:
        bool: if classification indicates Benign level
    """
    if bs_terms:
        # Likely Benign (i)
        if bp_terms:
            return True
    # Likely Benign (ii)
    if len(bp_terms) >= 2:
        return True

    return False
    ```
    Can you generate another code that is different from this one, but produces the same output given the same input?

## chatgpt: 

Sure, here's another implementation that produces the same output for the same input:

```python
def is_likely_benign(bs_terms, bp_terms):
    """Check if criterias for Likely Benign are fullfilled

    The following are descriptions of Likely Benign clasification from ACMG paper:

    Likely Benign
      (i) 1 Strong (BS1每BS4) and 1 supporting (BP1每 BP7) OR
      (ii) ≡2 Supporting (BP1每BP7)

    Args:
        bs_terms(list(str)): Terms that indicate strong evidence for benign variant
        bp_terms(list(str)): Terms that indicate supporting evidence for benign variant

    Returns:
        bool: if classification indicates Benign level
    """
    if len(bs_terms) >= 1 and len(bp_terms) >= 1:
        # Likely Benign (i)
        return True
    # Likely Benign (ii)
    if len(bp_terms) >= 2:
        return True

    return False
```

This implementation checks if there is at least one term indicating strong evidence for benign variant (i.e., `len(bs_terms) >= 1`) and at least one term indicating supporting evidence for benign variant (i.e., `len(bp_terms) >= 1`), which corresponds to the criteria (i) in the ACMG paper. If this is the case, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it checks if there are at least two terms indicating supporting evidence for benign variant (i.e., `len(bp_terms) >= 2`), which corresponds to the criteria (ii) in the ACMG paper. If this is the case, it returns `True`. If neither criteria is met, it returns `False`.
