Create a model that can generate semantically equivalent Python code for any given input. The generated code should meet the requirement of having the exact same output when given the same input.

The generated code should not import any external libraries that are not used in the original code. There are no constraints on the length or complexity of the generated code, correctness is the most important factor. If possible, the generated code should be shorter and less complex than the original code.

Here's the code I want you to generate about:
    ```python
    def tag_to_text(tag):
    """
    :param tag: Beautiful soup tag
    :return: Flattened text
    """
    out = []
    for item in tag.contents:
        # If it has a name, it is a tag
        if item.name:
            out.append(tag_to_text(item))
        else:
            # Just text!
            out.append(item)

    return ' '.join(out)
    ```

Here's the code I generated:

```python
def tag_to_text(tag):
    """
    :param tag: Beautiful soup tag
    :return: Flattened text
    """
    out = [item if not item.name else tag_to_text(item) for item in tag.contents]
    return ' '.join(out)
```

This code has the same functionality as the original code, but it uses a list comprehension instead of a for loop with an if-else statement. The list comprehension checks whether a content item has a name attribute, and if it does, it recursively calls the tag_to_text function on that item. Otherwise, it appends the text of the content item to the output list. The output list is then joined into a string and returned.

The generated code is shorter than the original code and has less complexity because it uses a list comprehension instead of a for loop with an if-else statement. The behavior of the code is the same as the original code, so there should be no changes in functionality when using the generated code instead of the original code.
