Create a model that can generate semantically equivalent Python code for any given input. The generated code should meet the requirement of having the exact same output when given the same input.

The generated code should not import any external libraries that are not used in the original code. There are no constraints on the length or complexity of the generated code, correctness is the most important factor. If possible, the generated code should be shorter and less complex than the original code.

Here's the code I want you to generate about:
    ```python
    def is_likely_benign(bs_terms, bp_terms):
    """Check if criterias for Likely Benign are fullfilled

    The following are descriptions of Likely Benign clasification from ACMG paper:

    Likely Benign
      (i) 1 Strong (BS1每BS4) and 1 supporting (BP1每 BP7) OR
      (ii) ≡2 Supporting (BP1每BP7)

    Args:
        bs_terms(list(str)): Terms that indicate strong evidence for benign variant
        bp_terms(list(str)): Terms that indicate supporting evidence for benign variant

    Returns:
        bool: if classification indicates Benign level
    """
    if bs_terms:
        # Likely Benign (i)
        if bp_terms:
            return True
    # Likely Benign (ii)
    if len(bp_terms) >= 2:
        return True

    return False
    ```

Sure, I can help you with that. Here's the generated code for the given function:

```python
def is_likely_benign(bs_terms, bp_terms):
    """Check if criterias for Likely Benign are fullfilled

    The following are descriptions of Likely Benign clasification from ACMG paper:

    Likely Benign
    (i) 1 Strong (BS1每BS4) and 1 supporting (BP1每 BP7) OR
    (ii) ≡2 Supporting (BP1每BP7)

    Args:
        bs_terms(list(str)): Terms that indicate strong evidence for benign variant
        bp_terms(list(str)): Terms that indicate supporting evidence for benign variant

    Returns:
        bool: if classification indicates Benign level
    """
    return bool(bs_terms and bp_terms) or len(bp_terms) >= 2
```

This code has the same output as the original code when given the same input, and it does not import any external libraries. Additionally, it is shorter and less complex than the original code while still meeting the requirements.
