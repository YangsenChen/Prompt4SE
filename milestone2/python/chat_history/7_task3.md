Now with the following code
    ```python
    def capwords(s, sep=None):
    """capwords(s [,sep]) -> string

    Split the argument into words using split, capitalize each
    word using capitalize, and join the capitalized words using
    join.  If the optional second argument sep is absent or None,
    runs of whitespace characters are replaced by a single space
    and leading and trailing whitespace are removed, otherwise
    sep is used to split and join the words.

    """
    return (sep or ' ').join(x.capitalize() for x in s.split(sep))
    ```
    Can you generate another code that is different from this one, but produces the same output given the same input?

## chatgpt: 

Yes, here is another implementation that produces the same output given the same input as the original implementation:

```python
def capwords(s, sep=None):
    """capwords(s [,sep]) -> string

    Split the argument into words using split, capitalize each
    word using capitalize, and join the capitalized words using
    join.  If the optional second argument sep is absent or None,
    runs of whitespace characters are replaced by a single space
    and leading and trailing whitespace are removed, otherwise
    sep is used to split and join the words.

    """
    if sep is None:
        return ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in s.split())
    
    return sep.join(word.capitalize() for word in s.split(sep))
```

This implementation checks if the `sep` parameter is `None` and uses a whitespace `' '` instead of `sep` for joining if it is.
