Write a set of unit tests for the given Python code snippet to ensure that it is functioning correctly. The unit tests should verify that the output produced by the function matches the expected output, without producing false negatives.
```python
def is_likely_benign(bs_terms, bp_terms):
    """Check if criterias for Likely Benign are fullfilled

    The following are descriptions of Likely Benign clasification from ACMG paper:

    Likely Benign
      (i) 1 Strong (BS1¨CBS4) and 1 supporting (BP1¨C BP7) OR
      (ii) ¡İ2 Supporting (BP1¨CBP7)

    Args:
        bs_terms(list(str)): Terms that indicate strong evidence for benign variant
        bp_terms(list(str)): Terms that indicate supporting evidence for benign variant

    Returns:
        bool: if classification indicates Benign level
    """
    if bs_terms:
        # Likely Benign (i)
        if bp_terms:
            return True
    # Likely Benign (ii)
    if len(bp_terms) >= 2:
        return True

    return False
```

Sure! Here is a set of unit tests for the `is_likely_benign` function:

```python
def test_is_likely_benign():
    # Test 1: No BS or BP terms
    bs_terms = []
    bp_terms = []
    assert is_likely_benign(bs_terms, bp_terms) == False

    # Test 2: 1 Strong and 1 Supporting BP term
    bs_terms = ["BS1"]
    bp_terms = ["BP1"]
    assert is_likely_benign(bs_terms, bp_terms) == True

    # Test 3: 1 Strong and 2 Supporting BP terms
    bs_terms = ["BS1"]
    bp_terms = ["BP1", "BP2"]
    assert is_likely_benign(bs_terms, bp_terms) == True

    # Test 4: 2 Supporting BP terms
    bs_terms = []
    bp_terms = ["BP3", "BP4"]
    assert is_likely_benign(bs_terms, bp_terms) == True

    # Test 5: 1 Strong BP term
    bs_terms = []
    bp_terms = ["BP5"]
    assert is_likely_benign(bs_terms, bp_terms) == False

    # Test 6: 2 Strong BP terms
    bs_terms = ["BS2"]
    bp_terms = ["BP6", "BP7"]
    assert is_likely_benign(bs_terms, bp_terms) == False
```

These tests cover various cases, including when there are no BS or BP terms, when there is one strong and one supporting BP term, when there is one strong and two supporting BP terms, when there are two supporting BP terms, when there is one strong BP term, and when there are two strong BP terms. These tests ensure that the function is behaving correctly and not producing false negatives.
