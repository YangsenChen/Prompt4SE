Write a set of unit tests for the given Python code snippet to ensure that it is functioning correctly. The unit tests should verify that the output produced by the function matches the expected output, without producing false negatives.
```python
def __jaccard(int_a, int_b):  # pragma: no cover
    '''Jaccard similarity between two intervals

    Parameters
    ----------
    int_a, int_b : np.ndarrays, shape=(2,)

    Returns
    -------
    Jaccard similarity between intervals
    '''
    ends = [int_a[1], int_b[1]]
    if ends[1] < ends[0]:
        ends.reverse()

    starts = [int_a[0], int_b[0]]
    if starts[1] < starts[0]:
        starts.reverse()

    intersection = ends[0] - starts[1]
    if intersection < 0:
        intersection = 0.

    union = ends[1] - starts[0]

    if union > 0:
        return intersection / union

    return 0.0

Here are the unit tests for the given Python code snippet:

```python
import numpy as np
import unittest
from your_module import __jaccard

class TestJaccard(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_jaccard(self):
        int_a = np.array([1, 5])
        int_b = np.array([3, 6])
        self.assertEqual(__jaccard(int_a, int_b), 0.25)

    def test_jaccard_no_intersection(self):
        int_a = np.array([1, 5])
        int_b = np.array([6, 10])
        self.assertEqual(__jaccard(int_a, int_b), 0.0)

    def test_jaccard_same_interval(self):
        int_a = np.array([1, 5])
        int_b = np.array([1, 5])
        self.assertEqual(__jaccard(int_a, int_b), 1.0)

    def test_jaccard_swapped_intervals(self):
        int_a = np.array([6, 10])
        int_b = np.array([1, 5])
        self.assertEqual(__jaccard(int_a, int_b), 0.0)

    def test_jaccard_tiny_intersection(self):
        int_a = np.array([1, 2])
        int_b = np.array([2, 3])
        self.assertEqual(__jaccard(int_a, int_b), 0.0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

The first test checks the case where the two intervals overlap only partially, while the second test checks the case where they have no overlap at all. The third test checks the case where they are identical, while the fourth test swaps the two intervals to ensure that the function is commutative. Finally, the fifth test checks the case where the overlap is very small (one point).

All tests use NumPy arrays as input, as expected by the function signature. The `assertEqual` method is used to compare the output of the function with the expected output. The tests cover the main branches of the function and ensure that it is working correctly.
