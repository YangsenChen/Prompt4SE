Write a set of unit tests for the given Python code snippet to ensure that it is functioning correctly. The unit tests should verify that the output produced by the function matches the expected output, without producing false negatives.
```python
def tag_to_text(tag):
    """
    :param tag: Beautiful soup tag
    :return: Flattened text
    """
    out = []
    for item in tag.contents:
        # If it has a name, it is a tag
        if item.name:
            out.append(tag_to_text(item))
        else:
            # Just text!
            out.append(item)

    return ' '.join(out)
```

Here is an example of a set of unit tests you could create for the `tag_to_text` function:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from unittest import TestCase

class TestTagToText(TestCase):

    def test_one_tag(self):
        html = "<p>This is a paragraph.</p>"
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
        tag = soup.p
        expected_output = "This is a paragraph."
        self.assertEqual(tag_to_text(tag), expected_output)

    def test_multiple_tags(self):
        html = "<div><p>This is a paragraph.</p><p>Another paragraph.</p></div>"
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
        tag = soup.div
        expected_output = "This is a paragraph. Another paragraph."
        self.assertEqual(tag_to_text(tag), expected_output)

    def test_nested_tags(self):
        html = "<div><p>This is <i>nested</i> text.</p></div>"
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
        tag = soup.div
        expected_output = "This is nested text."
        self.assertEqual(tag_to_text(tag), expected_output)

    def test_empty_tag(self):
        html = "<p></p>"
        soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
        tag = soup.p
        expected_output = ""
        self.assertEqual(tag_to_text(tag), expected_output)
```

These tests cover a range of scenarios that the function might encounter, including simple and nested tags, empty tags, and multiple tags. By creating these tests and running them against the function, you can be confident that it is working correctly and will not produce false negatives.
