Now with the following code
    ```python
    def count_list(the_list):
    """
    Generates a count of the number of times each unique item appears in a list
    """
    count = the_list.count
    result = [(item, count(item)) for item in set(the_list)]
    result.sort()
    return result
    ```
    Can you generate another code that is different from this one, but produces the same output given the same input?

Sure! Here's an alternative implementation of the `count_list` function that achieves the same output as the original code snippet:

```python
def count_list(the_list):
    """
    Generates a count of the number of times each unique item appears in a list
    """
    counts = {}
    for item in the_list:
        if item not in counts:
            counts[item] = 0
        counts[item] += 1
        
    result = [(item, count) for item, count in counts.items()]
    result.sort()
    
    return result
```

This implementation of the `count_list` function creates a dictionary to store the counts of each unique item in the input list. We then iterate over each item in the input list, incrementing the count for that item in the `counts` dictionary. Finally, we create a list of tuples from the `counts` dictionary, with each tuple containing an item and its corresponding count. We then sort the list of tuples by the items to produce the same output as the original code snippet.
