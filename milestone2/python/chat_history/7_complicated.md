Write a set of unit tests for the given Python code snippet to ensure that it is functioning correctly. The unit tests should verify that the output produced by the function matches the expected output, without producing false negatives.
```python
def capwords(s, sep=None):
    """capwords(s [,sep]) -> string

    Split the argument into words using split, capitalize each
    word using capitalize, and join the capitalized words using
    join.  If the optional second argument sep is absent or None,
    runs of whitespace characters are replaced by a single space
    and leading and trailing whitespace are removed, otherwise
    sep is used to split and join the words.

    """
    return (sep or ' ').join(x.capitalize() for x in s.split(sep))
```

Sure, here are some unit tests for the `capwords` function:

```python
def test_capwords():
    assert capwords("hello world") == "Hello World"
    assert capwords(" foo bar baz ") == "Foo Bar Baz"
    assert capwords("camelCase") == "Camelcase"
    assert capwords("1 2 3 4 5") == "1 2 3 4 5"
    assert capwords("one,two,three", sep=",") == "One,Two,Three"
    assert capwords(" speak to me ", sep="to") == " Speak To Me "
```

These unit tests verify that the function works correctly for different kinds of input strings and separator arguments, and produces the expected output.
