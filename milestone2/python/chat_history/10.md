## user: 

Now with the following code
```python
def tag_to_text(tag):
    """
    :param tag: Beautiful soup tag
    :return: Flattened text
    """
    out = []
    for item in tag.contents:
        # If it has a name, it is a tag
        if item.name:
            out.append(tag_to_text(item))
        else:
            # Just text!
            out.append(item)

    return ' '.join(out)
```
Can you give me a reasonable unit test for the method?

Certainly! Here is a reasonable unit test for the `tag_to_text` method:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def test_tag_to_text():
    # Create a Beautiful Soup tag
    html = "<html><body><h1>Hello, world!</h1><p>This is a paragraph.</p></body></html>"
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    
    # Call the tag_to_text function on the tag
    flattened_text = tag_to_text(soup)
    
    # Check that the result is what we expect
    expected_text = "Hello, world! This is a paragraph."
    assert flattened_text == expected_text, f"Expected {expected_text}, but got {flattened_text}"
```

In this unit test, we create a simple HTML document, parse it into a Beautiful Soup tag using the `html.parser`, call the `tag_to_text` function on the tag, and check that the result is equal to the expected text. This should test that the `tag_to_text` method correctly flattens the text of a Beautiful Soup tag.
