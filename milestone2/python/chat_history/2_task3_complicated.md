Create a model that can generate semantically equivalent Python code for any given input. The generated code should meet the requirement of having the exact same output when given the same input.

The generated code should not import any external libraries that are not used in the original code. There are no constraints on the length or complexity of the generated code, correctness is the most important factor. If possible, the generated code should be shorter and less complex than the original code.

Here's the code I want you to generate about:
    ```python
    def count_list(the_list):
    """
    Generates a count of the number of times each unique item appears in a list
    """
    count = the_list.count
    result = [(item, count(item)) for item in set(the_list)]
    result.sort()
    return result
    ```

Here's the generated code that satisfies the given requirements: 

```python
from collections import Counter

def count_list(the_list):
    """
    Generates a count of the number of times each unique item appears in a list
    """
    count_dict = dict(Counter(the_list))
    result = [(item, count_dict[item]) for item in sorted(count_dict)]
    return result
```

Instead of using the `count` method of the `list` class, which is an O(n) operation, the generated code uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each unique item in the list. The `Counter` class uses a dictionary to store the counts, which is faster than using the `count` method for each item.

The result is then built using a list comprehension and a dictionary lookup, and then sorted by item for consistency with the original code. The resulting code is more concise and arguably more efficient than the original code, while producing the same output for any given input.
