Now with the following code
```python
def count_list(the_list):
    """
    Generates a count of the number of times each unique item appears in a list
    """
    count = the_list.count
    result = [(item, count(item)) for item in set(the_list)]
    result.sort()
    return result
```
Can you give me a reasonable unit test for the method?

Sure, here's an example of a unit test for the `count_list` function:

```python
def test_count_list():
    # Test a basic input list
    input_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
    expected_output = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]
    assert count_list(input_list) == expected_output
    
    # Test with an empty list
    input_list = []
    expected_output = []
    assert count_list(input_list) == expected_output
    
    # Test with a list of identical elements
    input_list = ['a'] * 5
    expected_output = [('a', 5)]
    assert count_list(input_list) == expected_output
    
    # Test with a list of strings
    input_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'cherry', 'cherry']
    expected_output = [('apple', 1), ('banana', 1), ('cherry', 3)]
    assert count_list(input_list) == expected_output
```
The first test case has a basic input list with multiple duplicates and expected output is correct. The second test confirms empty list edge case. The third test having a list of identical elements and the last case with counting string types of input list.
