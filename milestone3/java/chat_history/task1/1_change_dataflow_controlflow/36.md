change the data flow and control flow of the following java code:
 ```java
public static List<Property> removeDups(List<Property> org) {
    List<Property> result = new ArrayList<>(org.size());
    for (Property p : org)
      if (!result.contains(p))  // O(n**2)
        result.add(p);
    return result;
  }
```



## chatgpt: 

Here's an updated version of the Java code with a modified data flow and control flow to improve its efficiency:

```java
public static List<Property> removeDups(List<Property> org) {
    HashMap<Property,Boolean> propertyMap = new HashMap<>(); // to keep track of visited properties
    List<Property> result = new ArrayList<Property>(); // to store distinct properties
    for (Property p : org){
        if (propertyMap.get(p) != null && propertyMap.get(p)){ // If the property already exists in the map
            continue;
        }
        result.add(p);
        propertyMap.put(p,true); // Adding the property to the map
    }
    return result;
}
```

In this updated version, we use a hashmap to keep track of the visited properties instead of using `List.contains()` which has a complexity of O(n^2). We loop through the original list and check whether each property already exists in the hashmap. If the property already exists, we skip it and move to the next one. If not, we add the property to the result list and mark it as visited in the hashmap. This way, we are able to avoid checking for duplicates in the result list for every property in the original list, significantly reducing the time taken. The control flow of the code is also modified to reflect this change in approach.

show me a more complex version of the code with modified data and control flow

Here's a more complex version of the Java code with a modified data flow and control flow to improve its efficiency. In this version, we'll use a `HashSet` to store the properties seen so far. 

```java
public static List<Property> removeDups(List<Property> org) {
    Set<Property> propertySet = new HashSet<>(); // to keep track of visited properties
    List<Property> result = new ArrayList<>(); // to store distinct properties
    for (Property p : org){
        if(propertySet.contains(p)){ // If the property already exists in the set
            continue;
        }else{
            propertySet.add(p); // Adding the property to the set
            result.add(p);
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

In this updated version, we use a `HashSet` collection to keep track of the visited properties instead of a hashmap which has a slight overhead cost in terms of memory. We loop through all properties of the input List and check whether each property already exists in the `HashSet`. If the property already exists, we skip it and move to the next one. If not, we add the property to the `HashSet` and we append its corresponding Property object to the list. We don't need to mark properties as visited since a `HashSet` only stores unique elements and returns false if we try to add a duplicate element. 

This way, we are able to avoid checking for duplicates in the result list as well as avoid using two different types `List` and `HashMap`, which could help to avoid unnecessary memory overheads. The control flow of the code is also modified to reflect this change in approach.
