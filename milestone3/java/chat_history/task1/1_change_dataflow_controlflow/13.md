change the data flow and control flow of the following java code:
 ```java
@Override
	public void write(HttpServletResponse httpResponse, Object value) throws IOException {
		((StreamHandler<?>) value).invokeHandler(httpResponse.getOutputStream());
	}
```



## chatgpt: 

Here's an example of changing the data flow and control flow of the provided Java code:

```java
@Override
public void write(HttpServletResponse httpResponse, Object value) throws IOException {
  if (value instanceof StreamHandler) {
    StreamHandler<?> handler = (StreamHandler<?>) value;
    OutputStream outputStream = httpResponse.getOutputStream();
    handler.invokeHandler(outputStream);
  } else {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Unexpected value type: " + value.getClass());
  }
}
```

In the modified code, we first check if the `value` parameter is an instance of the `StreamHandler` class. If it is, we cast it to the appropriate type and save it in a new variable called `handler`.

Next, we obtain the output stream from the `httpResponse` using the `getOutputStream` method and save it in a new variable called `outputStream`.

Finally, we call the `invokeHandler` method on the `handler` object, passing in the `outputStream` as a parameter.

If the `value` parameter is not an instance of the `StreamHandler` class, we throw an exception to indicate that we encountered an unexpected value type.

show me a more complex version of the code with modified data and control flow

Here's an example of a more complex version of the provided Java code with modified data and control flow:

```java
@Override
public void write(HttpServletResponse httpResponse, Object value) throws IOException {
  if (value instanceof StreamHandler) {
    StreamHandler<?> handler = (StreamHandler<?>) value;
    if (handler.isAuthorized()) {
      OutputStream outputStream = httpResponse.getOutputStream();
      try {
        handler.prepareHandler();
        handler.invokeHandler(outputStream);
      } catch (HandlerException e) {
        throw new IOException("Error occurred while invoking the handler", e);
      } finally {
        handler.cleanupHandler();
      }
    } else {
      httpResponse.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED);
    }
  } else {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Unexpected value type: " + value.getClass());
  }
}
```

In this modified code, we first check if the `value` parameter is an instance of the `StreamHandler` class using the `instanceof` operator. If it is, we cast it to the appropriate type and save it in a new variable called `handler`. If it is not, we throw an exception to indicate that we encountered an unexpected value type.

Next, we call the `isAuthorized` method on the `handler` object to check if the user is authorized to access the resource. If the user is authorized, we obtain the output stream from the `httpResponse` object using the `getOutputStream` method and save it in a new variable called `outputStream`.

After that, we call the `prepareHandler` method on the `handler` object to prepare the handler for invocation. If an exception is thrown during the preparation phase, we catch it and rethrow it as an `IOException`.

Then, we call the `invokeHandler` method on the `handler` object, passing in the `outputStream` as a parameter. If an exception is thrown during the invocation phase, we catch it and rethrow it as an `IOException`.

Finally, we call the `cleanupHandler` method on the `handler` object to clean up any resources used by the handler.

If the user is not authorized to access the resource, we send a HTTP error response with the status code `SC_UNAUTHORIZED`.
