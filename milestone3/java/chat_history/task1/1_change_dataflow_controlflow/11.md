change the data flow and control flow of the following java code:
 ```java
boolean hasActivityAndNotEndOfStream(final long nowNs)
    {
        boolean isActive = true;

        if (((lastPacketTimestampNs + imageLivenessTimeoutNs) - nowNs < 0) ||
            (isEndOfStream && rebuildPosition.getVolatile() >= hwmPosition.get()))
        {
            isActive = false;
        }

        return isActive;
    }
```

Here is the modified code with altered data flow and control flow:

```java
boolean hasActivityAndNotEndOfStream(final long nowNs)
{
    boolean isActive;

    long timeoutThreshold = lastPacketTimestampNs + imageLivenessTimeoutNs;
    boolean areLivenessPacketsTimedOut = timeoutThreshold - nowNs < 0;

    boolean isStreamComplete = isEndOfStream && rebuildPosition.getVolatile() >= hwmPosition.get();

    if (areLivenessPacketsTimedOut || isStreamComplete) {
        isActive = false;
    } else {
        isActive = true;
    }

    return isActive;
}
```

The original code had a single expression in the `if` statement that would evaluate to `true` or `false`, which was then assigned to the variable `isActive`. In the modified code, the expression is split into two parts, and each part is assigned to a separate variable. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

Additionally, the modified code introduces a `timeoutThreshold` variable to calculate the timeout threshold separately, making the code easier to read. Finally, the `else` block is added to improve the readability of the code, although it could be removed to achieve the same functionality.

show me a more complex version of the code with modified data and control flow

## chatgpt: 

Here's a more complex version of the code with modified data and control flow:

```java
boolean hasActivityAndNotEndOfStream(final long nowNs, final List<Packet> packets, final int maxConsecutiveEmptyPackets, final boolean streamPaused, final boolean streamStopped) {
    int numConsecutiveEmptyPackets = 0;
    boolean hasActivity = false;

    // check if stream is paused or stopped
    if (streamPaused || streamStopped) {
        return false;
    }

    // iterate through packets and check if any packets have been received
    for (final Packet packet : packets) {
        if (packet != null) {
            numConsecutiveEmptyPackets = 0;
            if (packet.isLivenessPacket()) {
                lastPacketTimestampNs = nowNs;
            } else {
                hasActivity = true;
            }
        } else {
            numConsecutiveEmptyPackets++;
        }

        // check if too many consecutive empty packets have been received
        if (numConsecutiveEmptyPackets > maxConsecutiveEmptyPackets) {
            hasActivity = false;
            break;
        }
    }

    // check if end of stream has been reached
    final boolean noMorePacketsExpected = packets.size() == 0 || packets.get(packets.size() - 1).isEndOfStreamPacket();
    final boolean endOfStreamPacketReceived = noMorePacketsExpected && packets.size() > 0 && packets.get(packets.size() - 1).receiptTimestampNs() > 0;
    final boolean isEndOfStream = noMorePacketsExpected && endOfStreamPacketReceived;
    if (isEndOfStream) {
        rebuildPosition.setVolatile(hwmPosition.get());
    }

    boolean isActive = hasActivity && !isEndOfStream;
    return isActive;
}
```

This modified version of the code takes into account a number of factors, including a list of packets, a maximum number of consecutive empty packets that can be received before the stream is considered inactive, and whether the stream is paused or stopped.

The code first checks if the stream is paused or stopped, and if so, returns `false`.

It then iterates through the list of packets, checking if any non-empty packets have been received and updating the `lastPacketTimestampNs` if a liveness packet is received. If too many consecutive empty packets are received, the code sets `hasActivity` to `false`.

The code then checks if the end of the stream has been reached and sets `isEndOfStream` accordingly. If `isEndOfStream`, the code updates `rebuildPosition`.

Finally, the code sets `isActive` to `true` if there has been any activity and the end of the stream has not been reached, and returns the value of `isActive`.
