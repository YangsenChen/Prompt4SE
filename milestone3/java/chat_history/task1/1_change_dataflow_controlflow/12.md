change the data flow and control flow of the following java code:
 ```java
private static void adjustPen()
  {
    //     Change the color of the line the tortoise draws to the next color on the color wheel --#6
    Tortoise.setPenColor(ColorWheel.getNextColor());
    //     Increase the tortoises pen width by 1 --#15                                               
    Tortoise.setPenWidth(Tortoise.getPenWidth() + 1.0);
    //     If the tortoise's pen width is greater than 4, then --#17
    if (Tortoise.getPenWidth() > 4)
    {
      //     Reset the pen width to 1 --#16
      Tortoise.setPenWidth(1);
    }
  }
```

Here is the modified Java code with the adjusted data flow and control flow:

```java
private static void adjustPen() {
    int nextColor = ColorWheel.getNextColor();
    double penWidth = Tortoise.getPenWidth();
    boolean isPenWidthGreaterThanFour = penWidth > 4;

    changePenColor(nextColor);
    increasePenWidth(penWidth);
    resetPenWidth(isPenWidthGreaterThanFour);
}

private static void changePenColor(int nextColor) {
    // Change the color of the line the tortoise draws to the next color on the color wheel
    Tortoise.setPenColor(nextColor);
}

private static void increasePenWidth(double penWidth) {
    // Increase the tortoise's pen width by 1
    Tortoise.setPenWidth(penWidth + 1.0);
}

private static void resetPenWidth(boolean isPenWidthGreaterThanFour) {
    // If the tortoise's pen width is greater than 4, then reset the pen width to 1
    if (isPenWidthGreaterThanFour) {
        Tortoise.setPenWidth(1);
    }
}
```

In the modified code, the main `adjustPen()` method is split into three smaller methods that encapsulate distinct functionalities. The `changePenColor()`, `increasePenWidth()`, and `resetPenWidth()` methods take in input arguments and perform the specific actions. 

Before modifying these separate methods, `nextColor`, `penWidth`, and `isPenWidthGreaterThanFour` are stored as variables within the `adjustPen()` method. This allows the method to have a clearer idea of what the variables' values are before invoking any external method calls.

The methods are now responsible for whether their respective functionalities are executed rather than relying on control flow of `if-else` statements within the main method. This makes the code easier to read, test, maintain, and modify, as each method's purpose is clearly defined.

show me a more complex version of the code with modified data and control flow

## chatgpt: 

Here is an example of a more complex version of the code with modified data and control flow:

```java
private static void adjustPen() {
    int nextColor = getNextColor(1, 10); // Generate a random color index between 1 and 10.
    double penWidth = Tortoise.getPenWidth();

    if (isRandomEventOccurred(0.1)) { // 10% probability that the pen width is randomly set to 1.
        setPenWidth(1);
    } else if (penWidth < 4) {
        setColorAndIncreaseWidth(nextColor, penWidth);
    } else {
        setColorAndDecreaseWidth(nextColor, penWidth);
    }
}

private static int getNextColor(int min, int max) {
    int range = max - min + 1;
    return (int) (Math.random() * range) + min; // Generate a random integer within the range [min, max]
}

private static boolean isRandomEventOccurred(double probability) {
    return Math.random() < probability;
}

private static void setColorAndIncreaseWidth(int colorIndex, double penWidth) {
    int color = ColorWheel.getColor(colorIndex);
    Tortoise.setPenColor(color);
    Tortoise.setPenWidth(penWidth + 1.0);
}

private static void setColorAndDecreaseWidth(int colorIndex, double penWidth) {
    int color = ColorWheel.getColor(colorIndex);
    Tortoise.setPenColor(color);
    Tortoise.setPenWidth(penWidth - 1.0);
}

private static void setPenWidth(double penWidth) {
    Tortoise.setPenWidth(penWidth);
}
```

In this version, the data flow has been modified by adding two new method calls that generate a random color index and determine whether a random event had occurred. By creating these new methods, we have increased the reusability of our code.

The control flow has also been modified to reflect more complex behavior. We first check if a random event has occurred. If it has, the pen width is reset to 1, bypassing any other logic. If not, we check whether the pen width is less than 4. If it is, we increase the pen width by 1 and set the pen color to a randomly generated color. Conversely, if the pen width is greater than or equal to 4, we decrease the pen width by 1 and set the pen color to a randomly generated color.

By organizing the code in this manner, we can add more complex behaviors easily without making the code convoluted or difficult to read. We achieved this by using small, reusable methods that perform specific tasks and by structuring the control flow in a way that it is easy to follow and reason about.
