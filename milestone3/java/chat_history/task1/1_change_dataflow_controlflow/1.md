change the data flow and control flow of the following java code:
 ```java
public final void setErrorConverter(Converter<Map<String, String>, OAuth2Error> errorConverter) {
		Assert.notNull(errorConverter, "errorConverter cannot be null");
		this.errorConverter = errorConverter;
	}
```



## chatgpt: 

Here's the updated code with changed data flow and control flow:
```java
public final void setErrorConverter(Converter<Map<String, String>, OAuth2Error> errorConverter) throws Exception {
    if (errorConverter == null) {
        throw new Exception("errorConverter cannot be null");
    }
    this.errorConverter = errorConverter;
}
```

The first change is in the control flow. We've added a `throws` clause to indicate that the method can throw an exception. Instead of using `Assert.notNull` to check if `errorConverter` is null, we're using an `if` statement to check if it's `null`. If `errorConverter` is null, we throw an exception with a message indicating that `errorConverter cannot be null`.

The second change is in the data flow. The input parameter `errorConverter` is used to set the `this.errorConverter` field. There is no change to this.

## user: 

show me a more complex version of the code with modified data and control flow

## chatgpt: 

Sure! Here's a more complex version of the code:
```java
public final void setErrorConverter(Converter<Map<String, String>, OAuth2Error> errorConverter) throws IllegalArgumentException, SecurityException {
    try {
        if (errorConverter == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("errorConverter cannot be null");
        }
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            AccessController.checkPermission(new AuthPermission("SET_ERROR_CONVERTER"));
        }
        this.errorConverter = errorConverter;
    } catch (SecurityException ex) {
        System.err.println("SecurityException: " + ex.getMessage());
        throw ex;
    }
}
```

In this version of the code, we've added additional checks in the control flow to enforce certain security permissions before allowing the `errorConverter` field to be set. We're using a `try-catch` block to manage any exceptions that may be thrown during this process.

In addition to the `throws` clause, we're now using two different types of exceptions: `IllegalArgumentException` and `SecurityException`.

The `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown if `errorConverter` is `null`, just like in the previous example. However, we're now setting the exception type to indicate that this is specifically an illegal argument.

The `SecurityException` is a new type of exception that's thrown if a certain security permission isn't granted. In this case, we're using the `AccessController.checkPermission` method with a specific permission (`"SET_ERROR_CONVERTER"`) to determine whether the current security context is allowed to set the `errorConverter` field. If the permission isn't granted, the method will throw a `SecurityException`.

Finally, if a `SecurityException` is thrown during this process, we're catching it and printing an error message to the console before re-throwing the exception.
