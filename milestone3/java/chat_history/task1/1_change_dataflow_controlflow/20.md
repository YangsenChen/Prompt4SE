change the data flow and control flow of the following java code:
 ```java
private int indexRows(long geoPackageId, FeatureCursor cursor) {

        int count = -1;

        try {
            while ((progress == null || progress.isActive())
                    && cursor.moveToNext()) {
                if (count < 0) {
                    count++;
                }
                try {
                    FeatureRow row = cursor.getRow();
                    if (row.isValid()) {
                        boolean indexed = index(geoPackageId, row, false);
                        if (indexed) {
                            count++;
                        }
                        if (progress != null) {
                            progress.addProgress(1);
                        }
                    }
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    Log.e(FeatureIndexer.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed to index feature. Table: "
                            + featureDao.getTableName() + ", Position: " + cursor.getPosition(), e);
                }
            }
        } finally {
            cursor.close();
        }

        return count;
    }
```

Here is the modified code to change the data flow and control flow:

```java
private int indexRows(long geoPackageId, FeatureCursor cursor) {

        int count = -1;

        if (cursor.moveToNext() && (progress == null || progress.isActive())) {

            do {
                if (count < 0) {
                    count++;
                }

                try {
                    FeatureRow row = cursor.getRow();

                    if (row.isValid()) {
                        boolean indexed = index(geoPackageId, row, false);

                        if (indexed) {
                            count++;
                        }

                        if (progress != null) {
                            progress.addProgress(1);
                        }
                    }
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    Log.e(FeatureIndexer.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed to index feature. " 
                          + "Table: "+ featureDao.getTableName() 
                          + ", Position: " + cursor.getPosition(), e);
                }
            } while ((progress == null || progress.isActive()) && cursor.moveToNext());
            
        }
        
        cursor.close();

        return count;
}
```

The modified code has a different control flow where the `while` loop has been changed to a `do-while` loop. This ensures that the loop runs at least once before checking the condition. Additionally, `cursor.close()` statement has been moved outside of the `try-finally` block. The modification to the data flow is in the use of the `do-while` loop instead of `while` loop. It ensures that the code checks the condition only after performing the loop actions at least once. This modification also helps the code to be more readable and maintainable.

show me a more complex version of the code with modified data and control flow

Here is a more complex version of the code, with the modified data and control flow:

```java
private int indexRows(long geoPackageId, FeatureCursor cursor, boolean indexWithProgress) {

    int count = 0;

    if (cursor == null || cursor.getCount() < 1) {
        return count;
    }

    try {
        if (cursor.moveToFirst()) {

            do {
                if ((progress == null || progress.isActive()) || !indexWithProgress) {
                    FeatureRow row = cursor.getRow();

                    if (row.isValid()) {
                        boolean indexed = index(geoPackageId, row, false);

                        if (indexed) {
                            count++;
                        }

                        // Update Progress
                        if (indexWithProgress && progress != null) {
                            progress.addProgress(1);
                        }
                    }
                } else {
                    // Progress is cancelled
                    break;  
                }

            } while (cursor.moveToNext());

        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.e(FeatureIndexer.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed to index feature.", e);
    } finally {
        cursor.close();
    }

    return count;
}
```

The modified code has a more complex control flow and additional parameters. The new `indexWithProgress` parameter is used to determine whether to update the progress while indexing or not. If `indexWithProgress` is true and `progress` is not null, then progress is updated for each indexed feature.

The method has multiple exit points dependent on the state of the cursor. If the cursor is null or with zero records, the method returns without processing anything. If progress is cancelled during the indexing, the loop will break early, and if an exception is thrown, the method will exit without closing the cursor which is handled by the `finally` block.

The `do-while` loop has been modified to check for the cancellation of progress, or the value of `indexWithProgress`. If `indexWithProgress` is false, the loop will not update progress, even if the `progress` variable is non-null.

Overall, these changes make the code more flexible and robust to handle various conditions while indexing feature rows.
