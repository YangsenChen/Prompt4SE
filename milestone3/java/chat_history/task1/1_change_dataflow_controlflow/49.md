change the data flow and control flow of the following java code:
 ```java
public int peakNextBits(int n) throws IOException {
        if (n > 8)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("N should be less then 8");
        if (nBit == 8) {
            advance();
            if (curByte == -1) {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        int[] bits = new int[16 - nBit];

        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = nBit; i < 8; i++) {
            bits[cnt++] = (curByte >> (7 - i)) & 0x1;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
            bits[cnt++] = (nextByte >> (7 - i)) & 0x1;
        }

        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result <<= 1;
            result |= bits[i];
        }

        return result;
    }
```



## chatgpt: 

Here is the modified code with a different control flow using a while loop instead of if statements: 

```java
public int peakNextBits(int n) throws IOException {
   int cnt = 0;
   int[] bits = new int[16];
   
   while(nBit < 8 && cnt < 16) {
      bits[cnt++] = (curByte >> (7 - nBit)) & 0x1;
      nBit++;
   }
   
   if (n > nBit) {
      advance();
      if (curByte == -1) {
         return -1;
      }
      
      nBit = 0;
      
      while(cnt < 16) {
         bits[cnt++] = (curByte >> (7 - nBit)) & 0x1;
         nBit++;
         
         if (nBit == 8) {
            advance();
            if (curByte == -1) {
               return -1;
            }
            
            nBit = 0;
         }
      }
   }
   
   int result = 0;
   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      result <<= 1;
      result |= bits[i];
   }

   return result;
}
```

In this modified code, the control flow has been changed to use a while loop to handle the bytes and bit positions more efficiently. The loop checks if there are enough bits currently available, and then advances to the next byte and starts over once the current byte has been processed. This improves the flow of the code as the logic for handling the bit position of the next byte has been moved inside the while loop, resulting in a cleaner and more efficient implementation.

## user: 

show me a more complex version of the code with modified data and control flow

## chatgpt: 

Here is a more complex version of the code with a modified data and control flow:

```java
public int[] peakNextBits(int[] buffer, int startIndex, int n) throws IOException {
    int endIndex = startIndex + n;
    if (endIndex > buffer.length)
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("End index should be less than the buffer length");

    int[] bits = new int[n];

    int currentByteIndex = startIndex / 8;
    int currentByteOffset = startIndex % 8;
    int remainingBits = n;

    while (remainingBits > 0) {
        int bitsToReadFromCurrentByte = Math.min(8 - currentByteOffset, remainingBits);
        int mask = (1 << bitsToReadFromCurrentByte) - 1;
        int bitShift = 8 - currentByteOffset - bitsToReadFromCurrentByte;

        int value = (buffer[currentByteIndex] >> bitShift) & mask;
        bits[n - remainingBits] = value;

        remainingBits -= bitsToReadFromCurrentByte;
        currentByteIndex++;
        currentByteOffset = 0;

        if (currentByteIndex < endIndex / 8) {
            mask = (1 << remainingBits) - 1;
            bitShift = 8 - remainingBits;

            value = buffer[currentByteIndex] >> bitShift & mask;
            bits[n - remainingBits - 1] |= value;

            remainingBits = 0;
            break;
        }
    }

    return bits;
}
```

The modified code reads `n` bits from a byte buffer starting at index `startIndex`. The control flow is more complex in this case as multiple bits may be read from a single byte if the requested number of bits spans multiple bytes. Also, the data flow has been modified so that all necessary data is read into variables before being processed. 

The main changes to the code are the use of the `currentByteIndex` and `currentByteOffset` variables to keep track of the current position in the byte buffer, and the `remainingBits` variable to ensure that the correct number of bits are returned. The use of the `while` loop enables the code to read multiple bytes until the requested number of bits is reached.

Overall, this version of the code is more complex but provides greater flexibility and efficiency in reading bits from a buffer.
