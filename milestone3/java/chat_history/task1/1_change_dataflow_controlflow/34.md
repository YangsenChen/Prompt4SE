change the data flow and control flow of the following java code:
 ```java
private ReceivedEmail addAttachment(final Part part, final byte[] content) throws MessagingException {
		final EmailAttachmentBuilder builder = addAttachmentInfo(part);
		builder.content(content, part.getContentType());
		final EmailAttachment<ByteArrayDataSource> attachment = builder.buildByteArrayDataSource();
		attachment.setSize(content.length);
		return storeAttachment(attachment);
	}
```



## chatgpt: 

Here's the modified Java code with a different data flow and control flow:

```java
private ReceivedEmail addAttachment(final Part part, final byte[] content) throws MessagingException {
    final EmailAttachmentBuilder builder = new EmailAttachmentBuilder();
    builder.setAttachmentInfo(part);
    builder.setContent(content, part.getContentType());
  
    final EmailAttachment<ByteArrayDataSource> attachment = builder.buildByteArrayDataSource();
    attachment.setSize(content.length);
  
    final AttachmentStorage storage = new AttachmentStorage();
    storage.store(attachment);
    
    final ReceivedEmail receivedEmail = new ReceivedEmail();
    receivedEmail.setAttachment(attachment);
  
    return receivedEmail;
}
```

- First, an instance of `EmailAttachmentBuilder` is created.
- Then set the attachment information is set by calling the `setAttachmentInfo()` method of `EmailAttachmentBuilder` with `part` as an argument.
- Next, the attachment content is set by calling the `setContent()` method of `EmailAttachmentBuilder` with `content` and `part.getContentType()` as arguments.
- After that, a `EmailAttachment` object is created by calling the `buildByteArrayDataSource()` method of `EmailAttachmentBuilder`.
- Then, the size of the attachment is set by calling the `setSize()` method of `EmailAttachment` with `content.length` as an argument.
- Next, an instance of `AttachmentStorage` is created.
- The `store()` method of `AttachmentStorage` is called with the `attachment` object as an argument to store the attachment.
- Finally, an instance of `ReceivedEmail` is created and the attachment is set by calling the `setAttachment()` method of `ReceivedEmail` with the `attachment` object as an argument.
- Finally, the `ReceivedEmail` object is returned.

show me a more complex version of the code with modified data and control flow

## chatgpt: 

Here's a more complex version of the code with a modified data and control flow, using a Builder pattern and exception handling:

```java
private ReceivedEmail addAttachment(final Part part, final byte[] content) throws AttachmentException {
	try {
		final EmailAttachmentBuilder attachmentBuilder = new EmailAttachmentBuilder();
		final EmailAttachment<ByteArrayDataSource> attachment = attachmentBuilder
				.setAttachmentInfo(part)
				.setContent(content, part.getContentType())
				.buildByteArrayDataSourceWithContentId();

		final AttachmentStorage attachmentStorage = new AttachmentStorage();
		final String attachmentId = attachmentStorage.storeAttachment(attachment);

		final AttachmentMetadataStorage metadataStorage = new AttachmentMetadataStorage();
		final AttachmentMetadata attachmentMetadata = new AttachmentMetadata.Builder(attachmentId)
				.setPartId(part.getContentID())
				.setContentType(part.getContentType())
				.setFileName(part.getFileName())
				.setSize(content.length)
				.build();
		metadataStorage.storeAttachmentMetadata(attachmentMetadata);

		final ReceivedEmailBuilder receivedEmailBuilder = new ReceivedEmailBuilder();
		final ReceivedEmail receivedEmail = receivedEmailBuilder
				.setFromAddress(part.getFrom()[0].toString())
				.setToAddress(part.getRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO)[0].toString())
				.setDate(part.getSentDate())
				.setSubject(part.getSubject())
				.setAttachment(attachment)
				.build();

		return receivedEmail;
	} catch (MessagingException e) {
		throw new AttachmentException("Failed to add attachment due to MessagingException", e);
	} catch (StorageException e) {
		throw new AttachmentException("Failed to add attachment due to StorageException", e);
	}
}
```

Here's how the data and control flow has changed:

- First, an instance of `EmailAttachmentBuilder` is created and used to build an `EmailAttachment` object by setting the attachment information and content.
- Then, an instance of `AttachmentStorage` is created and used to store the attachment.
- If storing the attachment is successful, an instance of `AttachmentMetadataStorage` is created to store metadata about the attachment.
- Then, an instance of `ReceivedEmailBuilder` is created to build a `ReceivedEmail` object and set its attributes, including the attachment.
- Finally, the `ReceivedEmail` object is returned.

In case of exceptions, these are caught and wrapped into an `AttachmentException` to provide more meaningful information about the error.
