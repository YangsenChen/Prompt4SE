given this example code: 

 public static void main { 
  system.out.println("Hello Word"); 
 } 
 you should output each line of the code like below: 
 line1: public static void main { 
  line2:      system.out.println("Hello Word");
 now given this code: 
  ```java
private Logger createLog()
   {
      Class<?> clazz = getClass();
      Logger logger = loggers.get(clazz);
      if (logger == null)
      {
         logger = Logger.getLogger(clazz);
         loggers.put(clazz, logger);
      }
      return logger;
   }
```

  output each line of the code:

## chatgpt: 

line1: `private Logger createLog()`
line2: `{`
line3: `Class<?> clazz = getClass();`
line4: `Logger logger = loggers.get(clazz);`
line5: `if (logger == null)`
line6: `{`
line7: `logger = Logger.getLogger(clazz);`
line8: `loggers.put(clazz, logger);`
line9: `}`
line10: `return logger;`
line11: `}`

ok, now reasoning step by step for each line of the code

## chatgpt: 

Sure! Here is a step-by-step explanation of each line of the code:

1. `private Logger createLog()`: This line defines a method called `createLog()` that returns an instance of the `Logger` class. The method is marked as `private`, which means it can only be accessed within the class that defines it.

2. `{`: This opening curly brace marks the beginning of the method's code block.

3. `Class<?> clazz = getClass();`: This line declares a variable called `clazz` of type `Class<?>` (which means it can be any type of class) and initializes it with the result of calling the `getClass()` method, which is inherited from the `Object` class. This gets the Class object for the class that declares the current method (`createLog()`).

4. `Logger logger = loggers.get(clazz);`: This line declares a variable called `logger` of type `Logger` and initializes it with the value returned from the `get()` method of the `loggers` map. The `loggers` map is presumably a member variable of the class that defines the `createLog()` method, and it maps `Class` objects to `Logger` objects. So, this line is getting the `Logger` associated with the `Class` object for the current method's declaring class (if there is one).

5. `if (logger == null)`: This line begins an `if` statement that checks if the `logger` variable is `null`. In other words, it checks if there is no `Logger` object associated with the current method's declaring class in the `loggers` map.

6. `{`: This opening curly brace marks the beginning of the `if` statement's code block.

7. `logger = Logger.getLogger(clazz);`: This line initializes the `logger` variable with a new `Logger` object retrieved from the `Logger.getLogger()` method. This method takes in a `Class` object and returns a `Logger` object that is associated with that class. So, this line creates a new `Logger` object for the current method's declaring class.

8. `loggers.put(clazz, logger);`: This line adds a new key-value pair to the `loggers` map, with the `Class` object for the current method's declaring class as the key and the new `Logger` object as the value. This ensures that the next time this method is called, the associated `Logger` object can be retrieved from the `loggers` map instead of creating a new one.

9. `}`: This closing curly brace marks the end of the `if` statement's code block.

10. `return logger;`: This line returns the `logger` variable, which now contains either the existing `Logger` object retrieved from the `loggers` map or a new `Logger` object created in the previous steps.

11. `}`: This closing curly brace marks the end of the method's code block.
