given this example code: 

 public static void main { 
  system.out.println("Hello Word"); 
 } 
 you should output each line of the code like below: 
 line1: public static void main { 
  line2:      system.out.println("Hello Word");
 now given this code: 
  ```java
private static void adjustPen()
  {
    //     Change the color of the line the tortoise draws to the next color on the color wheel --#6
    Tortoise.setPenColor(ColorWheel.getNextColor());
    //     Increase the tortoises pen width by 1 --#15                                               
    Tortoise.setPenWidth(Tortoise.getPenWidth() + 1.0);
    //     If the tortoise's pen width is greater than 4, then --#17
    if (Tortoise.getPenWidth() > 4)
    {
      //     Reset the pen width to 1 --#16
      Tortoise.setPenWidth(1);
    }
  }
```

  output each line of the code:

ok, now reasoning step by step for each line of the code

## chatgpt: 

Sure thing! Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what each line of the code is doing:

line1: `private static void adjustPen()`
- This is a method definition for a `private` and `static` method named `adjustPen`. The return type of the method is `void` which means it does not return any values.

line2: `{`
- This is opening up a block of code for the `adjustPen` method.

line3: `//     Change the color of the line the tortoise draws to the next color on the color wheel --#6`
- This is a comment in the code that describes what the code on line 4 does.

line4: `Tortoise.setPenColor(ColorWheel.getNextColor());`
- This line of code is setting the color of the line that the `Tortoise` object draws to the next color in the `ColorWheel`. The `ColorWheel` is a predefined object that contains a circular array of colors.

line5: `//     Increase the tortoises pen width by 1 --#15`
- This is another comment that describes what the code on line 6 does.

line6: `Tortoise.setPenWidth(Tortoise.getPenWidth() + 1.0);`
- This line of code is increasing the width of the pen that the `Tortoise` object is drawing with by 1.0.

line7: `//     If the tortoise's pen width is greater than 4, then --#17`
- This is a comment that describes the condition of the if statement on line 8.

line8: `if (Tortoise.getPenWidth() > 4)`
- This is an if statement that checks if the pen width of the `Tortoise` object is greater than 4. If it is, then the code inside the if statement block will execute.

line9: `{`
- This is opening up a block of code for the if statement.

line10: `//     Reset the pen width to 1 --#16`
- This is a comment that describes what the code on line 11 does.

line11: `Tortoise.setPenWidth(1);`
- This line of code is setting the pen width of the `Tortoise` object to 1.

line12: `}`
- This is closing the block of code for the if statement.

line13: `}`
- This is closing the block of code for the `adjustPen` method.
