given this example code: 

 public static void main { 
  system.out.println("Hello Word"); 
 } 
 you should output each line of the code like below: 
 line1: public static void main { 
  line2:      system.out.println("Hello Word");
 now given this code: 
  ```java
private int indexRows(long geoPackageId, FeatureCursor cursor) {

        int count = -1;

        try {
            while ((progress == null || progress.isActive())
                    && cursor.moveToNext()) {
                if (count < 0) {
                    count++;
                }
                try {
                    FeatureRow row = cursor.getRow();
                    if (row.isValid()) {
                        boolean indexed = index(geoPackageId, row, false);
                        if (indexed) {
                            count++;
                        }
                        if (progress != null) {
                            progress.addProgress(1);
                        }
                    }
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    Log.e(FeatureIndexer.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed to index feature. Table: "
                            + featureDao.getTableName() + ", Position: " + cursor.getPosition(), e);
                }
            }
        } finally {
            cursor.close();
        }

        return count;
    }
```

  output each line of the code:

## user: 

ok, now reasoning step by step for each line of the code

## chatgpt: 

Sure, I can provide some explanation for each line of the code.

line1: `private int indexRows(long geoPackageId, FeatureCursor cursor) {`
- This is a method declaration for a private method called "indexRows". It takes in two parameters - a long value and a reference to a FeatureCursor object - and returns an integer value.

line2: `int count = -1;`
- Initializes a local variable called "count" to a value of -1.

line3: `try {`
- Begins a try block, which is used for exception handling.

line4: `while ((progress == null || progress.isActive()) && cursor.moveToNext()) {`
- This is a while loop that will continue until either "progress" is null or not active, or until the cursor cannot be moved to the next element.

line5: `if (count < 0) {`
- A conditional statement that checks whether "count" is less than 0.

line6: `count++;`
- If the condition in line 5 is true, increments "count" by 1.

line7: `}`
- End of the if statement in line 5.

line8: `try {`
- Begins a nested try block.

line9: `FeatureRow row = cursor.getRow();`
- Initializes a new FeatureRow object called "row" with the row that the cursor is currently pointing to.

line10: `if (row.isValid()) {`
- Conditional statement that checks whether the FeatureRow object is valid.

line11: `boolean indexed = index(geoPackageId, row, false);`
- Calls the "index" method passing in geoPackageId, "row", and false as parameters and stores its result in a boolean variable "indexed".

line12: `if (indexed) {`
- Conditional statement that checks whether the "indexed" variable is true.

line13: `count++;`
- If the condition in line 12 is true, increments "count" by 1.

line14: `}`
- End of the if statement in line 12.

line15: `if (progress != null) {`
- Conditional statement that checks whether the "progress" object is not null.

line16: `progress.addProgress(1);`
- Calls the "addProgress" method of the "progress" object, adding 1 as a parameter.

line17: `}`
- End of the if statement in line 15.

line18: `}`
- End of the try block started in line 8.

line19: `} catch (Exception e) {`
- Starts a catch block that catches any exception of type "Exception".

line20: `Log.e(FeatureIndexer.class.getSimpleName(), "Failed to index feature. Table: " + featureDao.getTableName() + ", Position: " + cursor.getPosition(), e);`
- Logs an error message with information about the feature being indexed, including the table name and position in the cursor.

line21: `}`
- End of the catch block.

line22: `}`
- End of the while loop started in line 4.

line23: `finally {`
- Begins a finally block that will execute no matter what happens in the try/catch block.

line24: `cursor.close();`
- Closes the "cursor" object.

line25: `}`
- End of the finally block.

line26: `return count;`
- Returns the "count" integer variable.

line27: `}`
- End of the entire method.
