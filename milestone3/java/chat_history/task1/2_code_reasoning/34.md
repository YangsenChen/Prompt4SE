given this example code: 

 public static void main { 
  system.out.println("Hello Word"); 
 } 
 you should output each line of the code like below: 
 line1: public static void main { 
  line2:      system.out.println("Hello Word");
 now given this code: 
  ```java
private ReceivedEmail addAttachment(final Part part, final byte[] content) throws MessagingException {
		final EmailAttachmentBuilder builder = addAttachmentInfo(part);
		builder.content(content, part.getContentType());
		final EmailAttachment<ByteArrayDataSource> attachment = builder.buildByteArrayDataSource();
		attachment.setSize(content.length);
		return storeAttachment(attachment);
	}
```

  output each line of the code:

## chatgpt: 

line1: private ReceivedEmail addAttachment(final Part part, final byte[] content) throws MessagingException {
line2: 		final EmailAttachmentBuilder builder = addAttachmentInfo(part);
line3: 		builder.content(content, part.getContentType());
line4: 		final EmailAttachment<ByteArrayDataSource> attachment = builder.buildByteArrayDataSource();
line5: 		attachment.setSize(content.length);
line6: 		return storeAttachment(attachment);
}

ok, now reasoning step by step for each line of the code

## chatgpt: 

Sure, here's a step-by-step breakdown of the given code:

line1: `private ReceivedEmail addAttachment(final Part part, final byte[] content) throws MessagingException {`
This line declares a private method called "addAttachment" with two parameters: a Part object called "part" and a byte array called "content". The method also declares that it might throw a MessagingException.


line2: `final EmailAttachmentBuilder builder = addAttachmentInfo(part);`
This line declares a new EmailAttachmentBuilder object called "builder", which is initialized with the result of calling the "addAttachmentInfo" method with the "part" parameter. The "final" keyword indicates that the variable "builder" cannot be reassigned after it's been initialized.


line3: `builder.content(content, part.getContentType());`
This line calls the "content" method on the EmailAttachmentBuilder object "builder", passing in the "content" and "part.getContentType()" parameters. 


line4: `final EmailAttachment<ByteArrayDataSource> attachment = builder.buildByteArrayDataSource();`
This line declares a new EmailAttachment object called "attachment", which is initialized with the result of calling the "buildByteArrayDataSource" method on the "builder" object. The "<ByteArrayDataSource>" is a type parameter indicating that the "attachment" object is of type EmailAttachment with a parameter type of ByteArrayDataSource. 


line5: `attachment.setSize(content.length);`
This line sets the size of the "attachment" object to the length of the "content" byte array by calling the "setSize" method on the "attachment" object.


line6: `return storeAttachment(attachment); }`
Finally, this line calls the "storeAttachment" method with the "attachment" parameter and returns the result. The method signature indicates that "storeAttachment" returns an object of type ReceivedEmail, which is what the "addAttachment" method also returns. 

Overall, this code is adding an attachment to an email (represented by a ReceivedEmail object) by building an EmailAttachment object using the "builder" object, setting its size, and storing it using the "storeAttachment" method.
