given this example code: 

 public static void main { 
  system.out.println("Hello Word"); 
 } 
 you should output each line of the code like below: 
 line1: public static void main { 
  line2:      system.out.println("Hello Word");
 now given this code: 
  ```java
@Override
    protected void doRow(FitRow row) throws Exception {
        currentCellParameter = FitUtils.extractCellParameter(row.cells().get(0));
        this.row = row;
        super.doRow(row);
    }
```

  output each line of the code:

## chatgpt: 

line1: @Override
line2: protected void doRow(FitRow row) throws Exception {
line3:     currentCellParameter = FitUtils.extractCellParameter(row.cells().get(0));
line4:     this.row = row;
line5:     super.doRow(row);
line6: }

ok, now reasoning step by step for each line of the code

## chatgpt: 

Sure, let's go through each line of the code and explain what it does:

line1: @Override
This is an annotation that indicates that the following method is meant to override a method in the superclass. This is useful for ensuring that a method that is intended to override a superclass method is correctly implemented.

line2: protected void doRow(FitRow row) throws Exception {
This is a method signature that defines a method called doRow that takes an argument of type FitRow and throws an Exception. The method is marked protected, which means it can only be accessed by subclasses of the class in which it is defined.

line3: currentCellParameter = FitUtils.extractCellParameter(row.cells().get(0));
This line calls a static method called extractCellParameter on the FitUtils class and passes it the first element of the cells list of the row argument. The resulting value is assigned to a variable called currentCellParameter.

line4: this.row = row;
This line assigns the value of the row argument to a member variable called row. The use of the "this" keyword is optional, but it is often used to clarify that the member variable is being assigned.

line5: super.doRow(row);
This line calls the doRow method of the superclass of the current class. This is usually done to ensure that the superclass implementation of the method is also executed.

line6: }
This is the end of the method.
