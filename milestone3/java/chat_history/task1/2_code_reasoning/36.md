given this example code: 

 public static void main { 
  system.out.println("Hello Word"); 
 } 
 you should output each line of the code like below: 
 line1: public static void main { 
  line2:      system.out.println("Hello Word");
 now given this code: 
  ```java
public static List<Property> removeDups(List<Property> org) {
    List<Property> result = new ArrayList<>(org.size());
    for (Property p : org)
      if (!result.contains(p))  // O(n**2)
        result.add(p);
    return result;
  }
```

  output each line of the code:

## chatgpt: 

line1: public static List<Property> removeDups(List<Property> org) { 

line2:     List<Property> result = new ArrayList<>(org.size()); 

line3:     for (Property p : org) 

line4:         if (!result.contains(p))  // O(n**2)

line5:             result.add(p); 

line6:     return result; 

line7: }

ok, now reasoning step by step for each line of the code

## chatgpt: 

Sure, here is a step-by-step reasoning for each line of code:

Line 1: `public static List<Property> removeDups(List<Property> org) {`

This line is a method signature. It declares a method called `removeDups`, which takes as input a `List` of `Property` objects and returns a `List` of `Property` objects. The `public` and `static` access modifiers indicate that the method is accessible from any code and can be called without an instance of the class that contains the method.

Line 2: `List<Property> result = new ArrayList<>(org.size());`

This line initializes a new `List` called `result`, which is an empty `ArrayList` of `Property` objects. The `ArrayList` is initialized with the size of the `org` list so that it can hold all the elements of `org`.

Line 3: `for (Property p : org)`

This line initiates a `for` loop that iterates through each `Property` object in the `org` list. The variable `p` is a reference to each item in the list as the loop progresses.

Line 4: `if (!result.contains(p)) // O(n**2)`

This line checks if the `result` list already contains `p`. If it does not contain `p`, the code inside the `if` statement will be executed. The `!` operator inverses the meaning of the `contains` method so that the block is triggered only if the list does not contain the current `Property`.

This operation has an O(n^2) time complexity, which means that it will take longer to complete as the number of items in the `org` list grows.

Line 5: `result.add(p);`

This line adds the current `Property` object to the `result` list if it was not already present in the list.

Line 6: `return result;`

This line returns the `result` list, which contains only unique `Property` objects, with duplicates removed.

Line 7: `}`

This line marks the end of the `removeDups` method.
