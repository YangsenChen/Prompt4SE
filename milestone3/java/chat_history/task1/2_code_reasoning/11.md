given this example code: 

 public static void main { 
  system.out.println("Hello Word"); 
 } 
 you should output each line of the code like below: 
 line1: public static void main { 
  line2:      system.out.println("Hello Word");
 now given this code: 
  ```java
boolean hasActivityAndNotEndOfStream(final long nowNs)
    {
        boolean isActive = true;

        if (((lastPacketTimestampNs + imageLivenessTimeoutNs) - nowNs < 0) ||
            (isEndOfStream && rebuildPosition.getVolatile() >= hwmPosition.get()))
        {
            isActive = false;
        }

        return isActive;
    }
```

  output each line of the code:

## chatgpt: 

line1: boolean hasActivityAndNotEndOfStream(final long nowNs)
line2: {
line3:     boolean isActive = true;
line4:     
line5:     if (((lastPacketTimestampNs + imageLivenessTimeoutNs) - nowNs < 0) ||
line6:         (isEndOfStream && rebuildPosition.getVolatile() >= hwmPosition.get()))
line7:     {
line8:         isActive = false;
line9:     }
line10:    
line11:    return isActive;
line12:}

## user: 

ok, now reasoning step by step for each line of the code

## chatgpt: 

Sure, here is a step-by-step reasoning for each line of the code:

line1: `boolean hasActivityAndNotEndOfStream(final long nowNs)`

The `hasActivityAndNotEndOfStream` function takes a `long` value `nowNs` as input and returns a `boolean` value. It is used to check whether there is activity in the system and if the stream has not ended.

line2: `{`

This line opens a code block.

line3: `boolean isActive = true;`

This declares a local boolean variable named `isActive` and initializes it with `true`.

line4: ` `

This line is a blank line, which does not have any specific functionality but separates the variable declaration from the next conditional statement.

line5: `if (((lastPacketTimestampNs + imageLivenessTimeoutNs) - nowNs < 0) || (isEndOfStream && rebuildPosition.getVolatile() >= hwmPosition.get()))`

This `if` statement checks whether the difference between the sum of `lastPacketTimestampNs` and `imageLivenessTimeoutNs` and `nowNs` is less than 0 OR `isEndOfStream` is true AND the value returned by `rebuildPosition.getVolatile()` is greater than or equal to the value returned by `hwmPosition.get()`.

line6: `{`

This line opens a code block.

line7: `isActive = false;`

This line sets `isActive` to `false`.

line8: `}`

This line closes the code block opened by line 6.

line9: ` `

This line is a blank line, which does not have any specific functionality but separates the conditional statement from the return statement.

line10: `return isActive;`

This line returns the current value of `isActive` as the output of the function.

line11: `}`

This line closes the code block opened by line 2.
