given this example code: 

 public static void main { 
  system.out.println("Hello Word"); 
 } 
 you should output each line of the code like below: 
 line1: public static void main { 
  line2:      system.out.println("Hello Word");
 now given this code: 
  ```java
public static <T> CompletableFuture<T> failAfter(final long duration) {
		final CompletableFuture<T> promise = new CompletableFuture<>();
		SCHEDULER.schedule(() -> {
			final TimeoutException ex = new TimeoutException("Timeout after " + duration);
			return promise.completeExceptionally(ex);
		}, duration, MILLISECONDS);
		return promise;
	}
```

  output each line of the code:

## chatgpt: 

line1: public static <T> CompletableFuture<T> failAfter(final long duration) {
 
line2:        final CompletableFuture<T> promise = new CompletableFuture<>();

line3:        SCHEDULER.schedule(() -> {
 
line4:            final TimeoutException ex = new TimeoutException("Timeout after " + duration);
 
line5:            return promise.completeExceptionally(ex);
 
line6:        }, duration, MILLISECONDS);
 
line7:        return promise;
 
line8:  }

ok, now reasoning step by step for each line of the code

## chatgpt: 

Sure, here's a line by line explanation of the code:

line 1: `public static <T> CompletableFuture<T> failAfter(final long duration) {`

This is a method declaration. The method returns a `CompletableFuture` object that can contain any type `<T>`. The method takes a parameter called `duration` of type `long`.

line 2: `final CompletableFuture<T> promise = new CompletableFuture<>();`

This line creates a new `CompletableFuture` object and assigns it to a variable called `promise`. The type of object that the `CompletableFuture` will contain is the same as the type returned by the method.

line 3: `SCHEDULER.schedule(() -> {`

This line is using an implementation of the `ScheduledExecutorService` interface to schedule a task to be executed at some point in the future. The `schedule` method takes two parameters: a `Runnable` task and a `long` delay.

line 4: `final TimeoutException ex = new TimeoutException("Timeout after " + duration);`

This line creates a new `TimeoutException` object and assigns it to a variable called `ex`. The message of the exception is constructed by concatenating the string "Timeout after " with the `duration` parameter.

line 5: `return promise.completeExceptionally(ex);`

This line calls a method on the `CompletableFuture` object called `completeExceptionally`. This method completes the `CompletableFuture` exceptionally with the specified `Throwable` argument. In this case, the `TimeoutException` object `ex` is passed in.

line 6: `}, duration, MILLISECONDS);`

This is the end of the `Runnable` task passed to the `schedule` method. The `delay` argument for the scheduling is specified in the previous line in the `duration` parameter, and it is in units of milliseconds.

line 7: `return promise;`

This line returns the `CompletableFuture` object that was created on line 2.

line 8: `}`

This is the end of the method declaration.
