given this example code: 

 public static void main { 
  system.out.println("Hello Word"); 
 } 
 you should output each line of the code like below: 
 line1: public static void main { 
  line2:      system.out.println("Hello Word");
 now given this code: 
  ```java
@Override
	public void write(HttpServletResponse httpResponse, Object value) throws IOException {
		((StreamHandler<?>) value).invokeHandler(httpResponse.getOutputStream());
	}
```

  output each line of the code:

## chatgpt: 

line1: @Override

line2: public void write(HttpServletResponse httpResponse, Object value) throws IOException {

line3:    ((StreamHandler<?>) value).invokeHandler(httpResponse.getOutputStream());

line4: }

ok, now reasoning step by step for each line of the code

## chatgpt: 

Sure, I can go through each line of the code and explain what it does:

Line 1: `@Override` is a notation used in Java that indicates that the method that follows it is intended to override a method with the same name in a superclass or interface. In other words, this code is telling the compiler that the `write` method that follows it is overriding a method in a parent class or interface.

Line 2: The `public void write(HttpServletResponse httpResponse, Object value) throws IOException {` declaration is the start of the `write()` method. This method takes two parameters - an `HttpServletResponse` object and an `Object` object - and throws an `IOException` if an error occurs.

Line 3: `((StreamHandler<?>) value).invokeHandler(httpResponse.getOutputStream());` is the body of the `write()` method. It casts the passed `value` object to a `StreamHandler<?>` object, and then calls the `invokeHandler()` method of the `StreamHandler` object, passing it the output stream of the `httpResponse` object.

Line 4: The `}` symbol marks the end of the `write()` method.
