given this example code: 

 public static void main { 
  system.out.println("Hello Word"); 
 } 
 you should output each line of the code like below: 
 line1: public static void main { 
  line2:      system.out.println("Hello Word");
 now given this code: 
  ```java
public String convertPropertyNameToColumnName(final String propertyName) {
		StringBuilder tableName = new StringBuilder(propertyName.length() * 2);

		if (splitCamelCase) {
			String convertedTableName = Format.fromCamelCase(propertyName, separatorChar);
			tableName.append(convertedTableName);
		} else {
			tableName.append(propertyName);
		}

		if (!changeCase) {
			return tableName.toString();
		}
		return uppercase ?
				toUppercase(tableName).toString() :
				toLowercase(tableName).toString();

	}
```

  output each line of the code:

## chatgpt: 

line1: public String convertPropertyNameToColumnName(final String propertyName) {
 
line2:      StringBuilder tableName = new StringBuilder(propertyName.length() * 2);

line3:      if (splitCamelCase) {

line4:           String convertedTableName = Format.fromCamelCase(propertyName, separatorChar);
 
line5:           tableName.append(convertedTableName);

line6:      } else {
 
line7:           tableName.append(propertyName);

line8:      }
 
line9:      if (!changeCase) {

line10:           return tableName.toString();

line11:      }

line12:      return uppercase ?
 
line13:            toUppercase(tableName).toString() :
 
line14:            toLowercase(tableName).toString();
 
line15: }

ok, now reasoning step by step for each line of the code

## chatgpt: 

Sure! Here's a step-by-step reasoning for each line of the code:

Line 1: This is the header of a method with the name `convertPropertyNameToColumnName`. It takes in a string argument called `propertyName` and returns a string.

Line 2: A new `StringBuilder` instance called tableName is created with initial capacity being twice the length of the `propertyName`. This is because if the string is split, the `convertedTableName` may have characters added to it, increasing the length of the string.

Line 3: The start of an if-statement. If the flag `splitCamelCase` is true, then the block of code following this line will execute. Otherwise, the block following line 6 will execute.

Line 4: A new string called `convertedTableName` is created and initialized to the output of the static method `Format.fromCamelCase`. This method takes in the `propertyName` and a `separatorChar` and returns the string with CamelCase converted into the `separatorChar` separated string.

Line 5: The `convertedTableName` string is appended to the `tableName` StringBuilder instance.

Line 6: The block of code to execute if `splitCamelCase` is false. The `propertyName` is directly appended to the `tableName` StringBuilder instance.

Line 7: End of the block commenced by Line 6.

Line 8: End of the if-statement commenced by Line 3.

Line 9: Start of an if-statement. If the flag `changeCase` is false, then the block of code following this line will execute.

Line 10: Return the `tableName` StringBuilder as a string if `changeCase` is false.

Line 11: End of the if-statement commenced by Line 9.

Line 12: Start of a conditional expression. If `uppercase` is true, then the block following line 13 will execute. Otherwise, the block following line 14 will execute.

Line 13: A static method called `toUppercase` is called on the `tableName` StringBuilder instance and then its result is returned as a string after converting it to a string.

Line 14: A static method called `toLowercase` is called on the `tableName` StringBuilder instance and then its result is returned as a string after converting it to a string.

Line 15: End of the method and end of the conditional expression commenced by Line 12.
