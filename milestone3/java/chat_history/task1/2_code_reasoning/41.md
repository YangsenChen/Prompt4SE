given this example code: 

 public static void main { 
  system.out.println("Hello Word"); 
 } 
 you should output each line of the code like below: 
 line1: public static void main { 
  line2:      system.out.println("Hello Word");
 now given this code: 
  ```java
@Deprecated
	protected void installJvmTypeProvider(XtextResourceSet resourceSet, File tmpClassDirectory) {
		internalInstallJvmTypeProvider(resourceSet, tmpClassDirectory, false);
	}
```

  output each line of the code:

## chatgpt: 

line1: @Deprecated
line2: protected void installJvmTypeProvider(XtextResourceSet resourceSet, File tmpClassDirectory) {
line3: 		internalInstallJvmTypeProvider(resourceSet, tmpClassDirectory, false);
line4: 	}

ok, now reasoning step by step for each line of the code

## chatgpt: 

Sure, here's a step-by-step reasoning for each line of the given code snippet:

Line 1: `@Deprecated` - This is an annotation in Java that indicates that the method or class being annotated is deprecated (or outdated), meaning that it is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in future versions of the code.

Line 2: `protected void installJvmTypeProvider(XtextResourceSet resourceSet, File tmpClassDirectory) {` - This line defines a method called `installJvmTypeProvider` that takes two arguments: an `XtextResourceSet` object called `resourceSet` and a `File` object called `tmpClassDirectory`. The method is marked as `protected`, which means that it can only be accessed by classes that inherit from the same package or class.

Line 3: `internalInstallJvmTypeProvider(resourceSet, tmpClassDirectory, false);` - This line calls a private method called `internalInstallJvmTypeProvider`, passing it the `resourceSet`, `tmpClassDirectory`, and the boolean value `false` as arguments. We don't have the code for this method, but it's likely that it's an implementation detail that the `installJvmTypeProvider` method relies on to complete its task.

Line 4: `}` - This is the end of the `installJvmTypeProvider` method.
