given this example code: 

 public static void main { 
  system.out.println("Hello Word"); 
 } 
 you should output each line of the code like below: 
 line1: public static void main { 
  line2:      system.out.println("Hello Word");
 now given this code: 
  ```java
private void insertLocatorIfDelayed(IMetric metric, MutationBatch mutationBatch, Clock clock) {
        Locator locator = metric.getLocator();

        long delay = clock.now().getMillis() - metric.getCollectionTime();
        if (delay > MAX_AGE_ALLOWED) {

            //track locator for configured granularity level. to re-roll only the delayed locator's for that slot
            int slot = DELAYED_METRICS_STORAGE_GRANULARITY.slot(metric.getCollectionTime());
            if (!LocatorCache.getInstance().isDelayedLocatorForASlotCurrent(slot, locator)) {
                insertDelayedLocator(DELAYED_METRICS_STORAGE_GRANULARITY, slot, locator, mutationBatch);
                LocatorCache.getInstance().setDelayedLocatorForASlotCurrent(slot, locator);
            }
        }
    }
```

  output each line of the code:

## chatgpt: 

line 1: private void insertLocatorIfDelayed(IMetric metric, MutationBatch mutationBatch, Clock clock) {
  
  line 2:    Locator locator = metric.getLocator();
  
  line 3:    long delay = clock.now().getMillis() - metric.getCollectionTime();
  
  line 4:    if (delay > MAX_AGE_ALLOWED) {
  
  line 5:        int slot = DELAYED_METRICS_STORAGE_GRANULARITY.slot(metric.getCollectionTime());
  
  line 6:        if (!LocatorCache.getInstance().isDelayedLocatorForASlotCurrent(slot, locator)) {
  
  line 7:            insertDelayedLocator(DELAYED_METRICS_STORAGE_GRANULARITY, slot, locator, mutationBatch);
  
  line 8:            LocatorCache.getInstance().setDelayedLocatorForASlotCurrent(slot, locator);
  
  line 9:        }
  
  line 10:    }

ok, now reasoning step by step for each line of the code

## chatgpt: 

Sure, I can do that. Here's a brief explanation for each line of the code you provided:

line 1: The method declaration for `insertLocatorIfDelayed`, which takes in three parameters: an `IMetric` object named `metric`, a `MutationBatch` object named `mutationBatch`, and a `Clock` object named `clock`. The method is declared as private, so it can only be accessed within the same class.

line 2: Declares a new `Locator` object, and assigns it the value of the `Locator` object returned by calling the `getLocator()` method on the `IMetric` object passed in as the `metric` parameter.

line 3: Calculates the `delay` variable by subtracting the `collectionTime` of the `IMetric` object passed in as the `metric` parameter from the current time returned by calling the `now()` method on the `clock` parameter. `delay` holds the difference in milliseconds between the two timestamps.

line 4: Checks if `delay` is greater than the `MAX_AGE_ALLOWED`. It's assumed that `MAX_AGE_ALLOWED` is a constant value declared somewhere else in the program.

line 5: Calculates the `slot` variable by calling the `slot()` method on the `DELAYED_METRICS_STORAGE_GRANULARITY` object, passing in the `collectionTime` of the `IMetric` object passed in as the `metric` parameter. This is used later in the code to determine which slot to insert the delayed locator into.

line 6: Checks if the current `locator` is already in the `LocatorCache` for the current `slot` by calling the `isDelayedLocatorForASlotCurrent()` method on the `LocatorCache` singleton instance, passing in `slot` and `locator`. If the locator is not already present, the next block of code is executed.

line 7: Inserts the `locator` into the `delayedLocatorBatch` associated with the given `slot` and `MetricStorageGranularity`. It does that by calling the `insertDelayedLocator()` method and passing in the `DELAYED_METRICS_STORAGE_GRANULARITY`, `slot`, `locator`, and `mutationBatch` parameters.

line 8: Marks the current `locator` as being present in the `LocatorCache` for the current `slot`, by calling the `setDelayedLocatorForASlotCurrent()` method on the `LocatorCache` singleton instance with `slot` and `locator` as parameters.

line 9: End of the `if` block initiated in line 6.

line 10: End of the `if` block initiated in line 4.
