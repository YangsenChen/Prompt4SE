The code defines a function `plot_boundaries()` which takes parameters `all_boundaries`, `est_file`, `algo_ids`, `title`, and `output_file`. The purpose is to plot the boundaries of an algorithm run along with the ground truth boundaries.

First, the `matplotlib` library is imported, and the number of lists of boundaries is determined by finding the length of the `all_boundaries` list. If `algo_ids` is `None`, it sets to a list of algorithm ids by calling `get_algo_ids()` function from `io` module. Then, using a for loop, it translates the ids into human readable format through a dictionary named `translate_ids`. The algorithm ids are appended to a new list starting with "GT" to denote the ground truth.

Next, the plot figure size is defined and a new figure is created with `figure()` function from `matplotlib.pyplot` module. Then, using another for loop, the `axvline()` function is called to create vertical lines at each boundary in each list with the color of the line changing depending on which list it belongs to. A horizontal line is also drawn between lists using the `axhline()` function.

Finally, the `plot_formatting()` function is called with specific parameters to format the plot and save it if applicable.

        Now change the data flow of the code, and provides me with a line by line reasoning of the new code. When changing the data flow, the output is not necessarily to keep unchanged. You can add arithmatic operations to the original data, but remember only change the original function, don't use external libraries or create new classes.

Here's an example of how the code could be changed to add arithmetic operations to the data:

```python
def plot_boundaries(all_boundaries, est_file, algo_ids=None, title=None, output_file=None):
    """Plots all the boundaries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    all_boundaries: list
        A list of np.arrays containing the times of the boundaries, one array
        for each algorithm.
    est_file: str
        Path to the estimated file (JSON file)
    algo_ids : list
        List of algorithm ids to to read boundaries from.
        If None, all algorithm ids are read.
    title : str
        Title of the plot. If None, the name of the file is printed instead.
    """
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    N = len(all_boundaries)  # Number of lists of boundaries
    if algo_ids is None:
        algo_ids = io.get_algo_ids(est_file)

    # Translate ids and add arithmetic operation
    for i, algo_id in enumerate(algo_ids):
        algo_ids[i] = f"Algorithm {i+1}: {translate_ids[algo_id]} ({len(all_boundaries[i]) * 2} boundaries)"
            
    # Add more boundaries
    for i, boundaries in enumerate(all_boundaries):
        all_boundaries[i] += boundaries + (boundaries * 2)

    algo_ids = ["GT"] + algo_ids

    figsize = (6, 4)
    plt.figure(1, figsize=figsize, dpi=120, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')
    # Change color of lines
    for i, boundaries in enumerate(all_boundaries):
        color = "r"
        if i == 0:
            color = "g"
        for b in boundaries:
            # Add arithmetic operation
            b *= 1.5
            plt.axvline(b, i / float(N), (i + 1) / float(N), color=color)
        plt.axhline(i / float(N), color="k", linewidth=1)

    # Format plot
    _plot_formatting(title, est_file, algo_ids, all_boundaries[0][-1], N, output_file)
```

First, the number of lists of boundaries is still determined by finding the length of the `all_boundaries` list. If `algo_ids` is `None`, it sets to a list of algorithm ids by calling `get_algo_ids()` function from `io` module. Then, using a for loop, it translates the ids into human-readable format through a dictionary named `translate_ids`. The algorithm ids are appended to a new list starting with "GT" to denote the ground truth. Additionally, each algorithm id's name now includes the number of boundaries that algorithm has, multiplied by two.

Next, a new for loop is added that doubles the number of boundaries in each list by concatenating the list with itself twice. Also, each boundary in each list has `1.5` multiplied to it.

Finally, the plot is created with new colors for the lines. The horizontal line is drawn as before. The `plot_formatting()` function is called with specific parameters to format the plot and save it if applicable.

        Now change the control flow of the code, and provides me with a line by line reasoning of the new code. When chaning the control flow, the output is not necessarily to keep unchanged. Remember only change the original function, don't use any external libraries or create new classes.

Here's an example of how the code could be changed to modify the control flow:

```python
def plot_boundaries(all_boundaries, est_file, algo_ids=None, title=None, output_file=None):
    """Plots all the boundaries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    all_boundaries: list
        A list of np.arrays containing the times of the boundaries, one array
        for each algorithm.
    est_file: str
        Path to the estimated file (JSON file)
    algo_ids : list
        List of algorithm ids to to read boundaries from.
        If None, all algorithm ids are read.
    title : str
        Title of the plot. If None, the name of the file is printed instead.
    """
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    N = len(all_boundaries)  # Number of lists of boundaries

    # Use a while loop so the user can input the algorithm ids
    while algo_ids is None:
        algo_ids = input("Enter a comma-separated list of algorithm ids to read boundaries from: ")
        algo_ids = algo_ids.split(',')
        try:
            # Translate ids
            for i, algo_id in enumerate(algo_ids):
                algo_ids[i] = translate_ids[algo_id.strip()]
            algo_ids = ["GT"] + algo_ids
        except KeyError:
            print("Invalid algorithm id(s). Please try again.")
            algo_ids = None

    figsize = (6, 4)
    plt.figure(1, figsize=figsize, dpi=120, facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')

    # Use a for loop to plot the lines
    for i, boundaries in enumerate(all_boundaries):
        color = "b"
        if i == 0:
            color = "g"
        for b in boundaries:
            plt.axvline(b, i / float(N), (i + 1) / float(N), color=color)
        plt.axhline(i / float(N), color="k", linewidth=1)

    # Format plot
    _plot_formatting(title, est_file, algo_ids, all_boundaries[0][-1], N, output_file)
```

The main control flow change is using a `while` loop to allow the user to input the algorithm ids they want to plot the boundaries for, rather than defaulting to all algorithm ids. The input is split on commas to create a list of ids and checked for validity with a `try`-`except` block. If the input is not valid, the user is prompted to try again.

The actual plotting of the lines and formatting of the plot is mostly unchanged, except that the algorithm ids are now stored in the main body rather than inside the conditional block, allowing them to be passed as parameters to `_plot_formatting()` as before.
