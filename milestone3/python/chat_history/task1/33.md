        Can you a line by line reasoning of the code below
        ```python
        def draw(self):
        """
        Redraws the menu and refreshes the screen. Should be called whenever something changes that needs to be redrawn.
        """

        self.screen.border(0)
        if self.title is not None:
            self.screen.addstr(2, 2, self.title, curses.A_STANDOUT)
        if self.subtitle is not None:
            self.screen.addstr(4, 2, self.subtitle, curses.A_BOLD)

        for index, item in enumerate(self.items):
            if self.current_option == index:
                text_style = self.highlight
            else:
                text_style = self.normal
            self.screen.addstr(5 + index, 4, item.show(index), text_style)

        screen_rows, screen_cols = CursesMenu.stdscr.getmaxyx()
        top_row = 0
        if 6 + len(self.items) > screen_rows:
            if screen_rows + self.current_option < 6 + len(self.items):
                top_row = self.current_option
            else:
                top_row = 6 + len(self.items) - screen_rows

        self.screen.refresh(top_row, 0, 0, 0, screen_rows - 1, screen_cols - 1)
        ```

The code provided is a method called `draw()` inside a `CursesMenu` class. Below is a line by line reasoning of the code:

```python
def draw(self):
```
This line defines a method called `draw()` that belongs to the `CursesMenu` class.

```python
"""
Redraws the menu and refreshes the screen. Should be called whenever something changes that needs to be redrawn.
"""
```
This is a docstring that explains the purpose of the `draw()` method.

```python
self.screen.border(0)
```
This line sets a border of 0 width around the screen.

```python
if self.title is not None:
    self.screen.addstr(2, 2, self.title, curses.A_STANDOUT)
```
If `self.title` is not `None`, this code adds the title to the screen and gives it standout properties, which means it will stand out from the rest of the text on the screen.

```python
if self.subtitle is not None:
    self.screen.addstr(4, 2, self.subtitle, curses.A_BOLD)
```
If `self.subtitle` is not `None`, this code adds the subtitle to the screen and gives it bold properties.

```python
for index, item in enumerate(self.items):
    if self.current_option == index:
        text_style = self.highlight
    else:
        text_style = self.normal
    self.screen.addstr(5 + index, 4, item.show(index), text_style)
```
This loop iterates over the menu items stored in `self.items`. For each item, it checks if the current option is the same as the index, and assigns a text style based on the outcome. It then adds the item to the screen with the assigned text style.

```python
screen_rows, screen_cols = CursesMenu.stdscr.getmaxyx()
```
This line gets the maximum number of rows and columns that can be displayed on the screen.

```python
top_row = 0
if 6 + len(self.items) > screen_rows:
    if screen_rows + self.current_option < 6 + len(self.items):
        top_row = self.current_option
    else:
        top_row = 6 + len(self.items) - screen_rows
```
This code calculates the top row of the screen to display. It checks if the total length of the menu items (including the header and border) is greater than the number of rows that can be displayed. If so, it checks if the current option is within the bounds of the screen. If it is not, it sets the top row based on a calculation, but if it is, it sets the top row to 0.

```python
self.screen.refresh(top_row, 0, 0, 0, screen_rows - 1, screen_cols - 1)
```
Finally, this code refreshes the screen with the calculated top row and screen dimensions.

        Now change the data flow of the code, and provides me with a line by line reasoning of the new code. When changing the data flow, the output is not necessarily to keep unchanged. You can add arithmatic operations to the original data, but remember only change the original function, don't use external libraries or create new classes.

As requested, I have changed the data flow of the code and modified the `draw()` method accordingly. Below is a line by line reasoning of the new code:

```python
def draw(self):
```
This line defines a method called `draw()` that belongs to the `CursesMenu` class.

```python
"""
Redraws the menu and refreshes the screen. Should be called whenever something changes that needs to be redrawn.
"""
```
This is a docstring that explains the purpose of the `draw()` method.

```python
self.header_height = 6 # new attribute to store the height of the header
self.footer_height = 2 # new attribute to store the height of the footer
```
These two lines of code create new attributes that store the height of the header and footer of the menu.

```python
self.screen_rows, self.screen_cols = self.screen.getmaxyx()
```
This line gets the maximum number of rows and columns that the current screen can display and stores them in `self.screen_rows` and `self.screen_cols`.

```python
self.content_rows = self.screen_rows - self.header_height - self.footer_height # calculate the number of rows available for the menu options
```
This line calculates the number of rows available for the menu options by subtracting the height of the header and footer from the total screen rows.

```python
self.top_option_index = max(0, self.current_option - self.content_rows + 1) # calculate the index of the top menu option to be displayed
```
This line calculates the index of the first menu option to be displayed by finding the difference between the current option index and the number of content rows available.

```python
self.bottom_option_index = min(len(self.items), self.top_option_index + self.content_rows) # calculate the index of the last menu option to be displayed
```
This line calculates the index of the last menu option to be displayed by finding the minimum between the total number of menu items and the top option index plus the content rows available.

```python
self.screen.clear() # clear the screen
self.screen.addstr(0, 0, self.title if self.title else "", curses.A_STANDOUT) # add the title if it exists
self.screen.addstr(1, 0, self.subtitle if self.subtitle else "") # add the subtitle if it exists
```
These lines of code clear the screen and add the title and subtitle to the screen if they exist.

```python
for i in range(self.top_option_index, self.bottom_option_index):
    item = self.items[i] # get the current menu item
    line_index = i - self.top_option_index + self.header_height # calculate the row to display the current menu item
    text_style = curses.A_BOLD if self.current_option == i else curses.A_NORMAL # add bold style to the current option
    self.screen.addstr(line_index, 0, item.show(i), text_style) # add the menu item to the screen
```
This loop iterates over the menu items within the range of `self.top_option_index` and `self.bottom_option_index`. For each item, it gets the current index and calculates the row to display the current menu item. It then checks if the current option is the same as the current index and assigns a text style accordingly. It finally adds the menu item to the screen with the assigned text style.

```python
self.screen.refresh()
```
This line refreshes the screen to show the updated menu options.

        Now change the control flow of the code, and provides me with a line by line reasoning of the new code. When chaning the control flow, the output is not necessarily to keep unchanged. Remember only change the original function, don't use any external libraries or create new classes.

As requested, I have changed the control flow of the code and modified the `draw()` method accordingly. Below is a line by line reasoning of the new code:

```python
def draw(self):
```
This line defines a method called `draw()` that belongs to the `CursesMenu` class.

```python
"""
Redraws the menu and refreshes the screen. Should be called whenever something changes that needs to be redrawn.
"""
```
This is a docstring that explains the purpose of the `draw()` method.

```python
if not self.screen.initscr():
    return
```
This code checks if the terminal can be initialized successfully. If not, the method returns without executing the rest of the code.

```python
curses.noecho() # disable output of user input to the screen
curses.cbreak() # react to key presses instantly
self.screen.keypad(True) # enable special keys like arrow keys
```
These lines of code setup the terminal so that user input can be captured.

```python
self.screen.clear() # clear the screen
self.screen.addstr(0, 0, self.title if self.title else "", curses.A_STANDOUT) # add the title if it exists
self.screen.addstr(1, 0, self.subtitle if self.subtitle else "") # add the subtitle if it exists
```
These lines of code clear the screen and add the title and subtitle to the screen if they exist.

```python
while True:
    self.screen.refresh() # refresh the screen
    curses.curs_set(0) # hide the cursor
    key = self.screen.getch() # capture user input

    if key == curses.KEY_UP and self.current_option > 0:
        self.current_option -= 1 # move the selection up
    elif key == curses.KEY_DOWN and self.current_option < len(self.items) - 1:
        self.current_option += 1 # move the selection down
    elif key == curses.KEY_ENTER or key in [10, 13]:
        self.items[self.current_option].action() # execute the selected menu item's action
    elif key == curses.KEY_RESIZE:
        self.draw() # redraw the menu if the terminal is resized
        continue
    elif key == curses.KEY_EXIT:
        self.screen.keypad(False) # disable special keys
        curses.curs_set(1) # show the cursor
        curses.nocbreak() # use line buffering
        self.screen.clear() # clear the screen
        curses.endwin() # exit curses
        return

    self.screen.clear() # clear the screen
    self.screen.addstr(0, 0, self.title if self.title else "", curses.A_STANDOUT) # add the title if it exists
    self.screen.addstr(1, 0, self.subtitle if self.subtitle else "") # add the subtitle if it exists

    for i, item in enumerate(self.items):
        text_style = curses.A_BOLD if self.current_option == i else curses.A_NORMAL # add bold style to the current option
        self.screen.addstr(i+2, 0, item.show(i), text_style) # add the menu item to the screen
```
This loop is the main control flow of the code, which allows the user to navigate through the menu options and select one. It first refreshes the screen and hides the cursor. It then captures the user's input and processes it. If the user presses the `UP` or `DOWN` arrow keys, it moves the current option up or down respectively, unless the current option is already the first or last option. If the user presses the `ENTER` key or equivalent, it executes the action of the selected menu item. If the user resizes the terminal, it redraws the menu. If the user presses the `EXIT` key or equivalent, it disables special keys, shows the cursor, uses line buffering, clears the screen, exits curses, and returns.

At the end of the loop, it clears the screen, adds the title and subtitle to the screen if they exist, and displays all menu items on the screen with the current option in bold style. The loop then repeats until the user selects an item or exits the menu.
