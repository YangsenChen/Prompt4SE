This is a method `_submit()` defined in a class, with six input parameters `client`, `config`, `osutil`, `request_executor`, `io_executor`, `transfer_future` and an optional input parameter `bandwidth_limiter`. 

The purpose of the method is to submit tasks for a transfer request to download a file from an S3 object. 

The input parameters are:
- `client`: the client associated with the transfer manager
- `config`: the transfer config associated with the transfer manager
- `osutil`: the OS utility associated with the transfer manager
- `request_executor`: the request executor associated with the transfer manager
- `io_executor`: the io executor associated with the transfer manager
- `transfer_future`: the transfer future associated with the transfer request that tasks are being submitted for
- `bandwidth_limiter`: the bandwidth limiter to use when downloading streams (optional)

If the size of the download is not specified, it queries the S3 server to obtain the size of the object. It then calls the `_get_download_output_manager_cls` method of the class to create an instance of a download output manager with the OS utility, transfer coordinator, and I/O executor. 

If the size of the object is less than the threshold specified in the transfer config, it submits a task to download the object as a single part by calling the `_submit_download_request` method.

Otherwise, if the size of the object is greater than or equal to the threshold, it submits a task to download the object as multiple parts by calling the `_submit_ranged_download_request` method.

        Now change the data flow of the code, and provides me with a line by line reasoning of the new code. When changing the data flow, the output is not necessarily to keep unchanged. You can add arithmatic operations to the original data, but remember only change the original function, don't use external libraries or create new classes.

        else:

        transfer_future.meta.size //= 2
```

In this modified code, the data flow has been changed to better demonstrate the functionality of the original code. Therefore, it is important to note that the changes made are not recommended practices.

To demonstrate the change in data flow, the following changes have been made:

- The size of the file is increased by 10 to represent some operation performed on the size of the file
- If the size of the file is not specified, an estimated size is calculated by multiplying the transfer threshold by an arbitrary coefficient of 3.
- Depending on the size of the object and the estimated size, the object is downloaded as either a single part or multiple parts.
- For large files that are downloaded in parts, the estimated time to complete the download is calculated based on the file size and the number of parts.
- The size of the file is reduced by half as another operation performed on the size of the file.

Note that these changes have been made only to demonstrate different operations that can be performed within the code. These are not recommended modifications as they will affect the functionality of the original code and may introduce errors.

                download_output_manager, transfer_future, bandwidth_limiter)
```

In this modified version, the control flow of the function has been changed to better demonstrate its functionality. Without using external libraries or creating new classes, the following changes were made.

- A new variable is introduced to hold a flag value based on the criteria that the transfer size is greater than or equal to (or less than) the multipart threshold.
- If the size of the transfer is not provided, an S3 `head_object()` call is made to obtain the size of the file. 
- The download output manager instance is created without checking the file size, rather information from the flag value is used to select between single/multiparts download
- The tasks are submitted based on the value of the flag as discussed above.

With these changes, the code's control flow is now based on the flag value, where the value of `use_multiparts` determines whether to download the file as a single part or in multiple parts.
