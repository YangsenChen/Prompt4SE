        Can you a line by line reasoning of the code below
        ```python
        def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        """Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
        AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
        added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
        """

        logger.info("Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete")
        for task_id in self.tasks:
            # .exception() is a less exception throwing way of
            # waiting for completion than .result()
            fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
            if not fut.done():
                logger.debug("Waiting for task {} to complete".format(task_id))
                fut.exception()
        logger.info("All remaining tasks completed")
        ```

Certainly, I can provide a line-by-line explanation of the Python code you shared:

First, there is a function definition called `wait_for_current_tasks` that takes one parameter, `self`. This suggests that the function might be part of a class definition.

```python
def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
```

Next, there is a docstring that explains what the function does and its limitations.

```python
"""Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
"""
```

After that, the function prints an informational message to indicate that it has started waiting for tasks to complete.

```python
logger.info("Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete")
```

The subsequent loop iterates over each task in the list of tasks and checks whether its associated `AppFuture` has completed or not. In case the task has not completed yet, the `wait_for_current_tasks` method logs a debug message indicating that it is waiting for the task to complete.

```python
for task_id in self.tasks:
	fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
	if not fut.done():
		logger.debug("Waiting for task {} to complete".format(task_id))
		fut.exception()
```

Note that `fut.exception()` is actually a way of waiting for the future to complete without throwing an exception. If the `AppFuture` has completed, there is no harm in calling `fut.exception()`, which will return either `None` or the exception object if the `AppFuture` has raised an exception. By doing this, we can wait for the task to complete without actually throwing any exceptions that we would have to handle.

Finally, once all tasks have completed, the function logs another informational message indicating that it has completed waiting for tasks.

```python
logger.info("All remaining tasks completed")
```

In summary, the `wait_for_current_tasks` method is a function that waits for all tasks in a list of tasks to complete by waiting for their associated `AppFutures` to complete, without necessarily waiting for any tasks added after cleanup has started. During its execution, it logs messages indicating what it is doing and what it has completed.

        Now change the data flow of the code, and provides me with a line by line reasoning of the new code. When changing the data flow, the output is not necessarily to keep unchanged. You can add arithmatic operations to the original data, but remember only change the original function, don't use external libraries or create new classes.

Sure! Here's an updated version of the `wait_for_current_tasks` function with changes to the data flow. 

```python
def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
    """Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
    AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
    added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
    """

    logger.info("Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete")
    total_completed_tasks = 0  # added to keep track of completed tasks
    task_ids = list(self.tasks.keys())  # iterate over copy of keys to ensure all items are processed
    for task_id in task_ids:
        fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']  
        if not fut.done():
            logger.debug("Waiting for task {} to complete".format(task_id))
            try:
                result = fut.result()  # perform some operation with the result to change the data flow
                total_completed_tasks += 1  # incrementing the count of completed tasks. 
            except Exception as e: # handling exceptions here
                logger.error(f"Task {task_id} failed with an exception: {str(e)}")
                raise e # re-raise the exception to indicate that the task has not completed successfully

            self.tasks.pop(task_id)  # remove completed tasks to prevent future loop iterations
    logger.info("All remaining tasks completed. Total completed tasks: {}".format(total_completed_tasks)) # log the total number of completed tasks
    return total_completed_tasks  # return the total number of completed tasks
```

Let's go through the changes line by line:

- We added a variable called `total_completed_tasks` to keep track of the number of completed tasks. It's initially set to `0`.
```python
total_completed_tasks = 0  
```

- We created a copy of the task IDs to ensure that all items in the dictionary are processed. This is necessary because we are modifying the `self.tasks` dictionary in the loop.
```python
task_ids = list(self.tasks.keys())
```

- We iterate over the task IDs and get the corresponding `AppFuture`.
```python
for task_id in task_ids:
    fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
```

- We check if the `AppFuture` has completed yet. If it hasn't, we log a debug message indicating that we are waiting for the task to complete. 
```python
if not fut.done():
    logger.debug("Waiting for task {} to complete".format(task_id))
```

- We perform some operation on the result of the `AppFuture` to change the data flow. In this case, we simply increment the count of completed tasks. Note that we are catching exceptions here and re-raising them to indicate that the task has not completed successfully.
```python
try:
    result = fut.result()  # perform some operation with the result to change the data flow
    total_completed_tasks += 1  # incrementing the count of completed tasks. 
except Exception as e: # handling exceptions here
    logger.error(f"Task {task_id} failed with an exception: {str(e)}")
    raise e # re-raise the exception to indicate that the task has not completed successfully
```

- We remove completed tasks from the dictionary to prevent future loop iterations.
```python
self.tasks.pop(task_id)
```

- At the end of the loop, we log the total number of completed tasks and return this value from the function.
```python
logger.info("All remaining tasks completed. Total completed tasks: {}".format(total_completed_tasks))
return total_completed_tasks
```

Overall, the changes we made to the `wait_for_current_tasks` function added additional functionality to keep track of completed tasks and change the data flow. The resulting output of the function will now be the total number of completed tasks, rather than just logging messages indicating that tasks are waiting and have completed.

        Now change the control flow of the code, and provides me with a line by line reasoning of the new code. When chaning the control flow, the output is not necessarily to keep unchanged. Remember only change the original function, don't use any external libraries or create new classes.

Certainly! Here's an updated version of the `wait_for_current_tasks` function with changes to the control flow.

```python
def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
    """Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
    AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
    added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
    """

    logger.info("Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete")
    total_completed_tasks = 0
    for task_id in self.tasks:
        fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
        while not fut.done(): # using a while loop to repeat task processing until done
            logger.debug("Waiting for task {} to complete".format(task_id))
            continue  # jump to the next iteration of the loop and check `fut.done()` again
        try:
            result = fut.result()
            total_completed_tasks += 1
            self.tasks.pop(task_id)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Task {task_id} failed with an exception: {str(e)}")
            raise e
    logger.info("All remaining tasks completed. Total completed tasks: {}".format(total_completed_tasks))
    return total_completed_tasks
```

Here's a line-by-line explanation of what changed:

- We replaced the `if not fut.done()` condition with a `while not fut.done()` loop. This means that we will continue to check whether the task is completed until it is actually completed while in the loop.

```python
while not fut.done():
    logger.debug("Waiting for task {} to complete".format(task_id))
    continue
```

- We added a `continue` statement inside the loop. This statement immediately jumps back to the beginning of the `for` loop to check for more completed tasks. Importantly, when `continue` is reached, any code below it in the loop is skipped.

```python
continue
```

- We moved the code block that removed completed tasks from the dictionary to the inside of the `try` block. This means that we will only remove tasks that have actually completed successfully. 

```python
try:
    result = fut.result()
    total_completed_tasks += 1
    self.tasks.pop(task_id)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Task {task_id} failed with an exception: {str(e)}")
    raise e
```

Overall, the control flow changes we made to the `wait_for_current_tasks` function will make it continuously check for task completion until all tasks are complete. This is in contrast to the original implementation, which simply checked each task exactly once and then stopped.
