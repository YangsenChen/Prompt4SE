## assistant:
The code itself is not buggy as its syntax seems to be correct and all the variables and functions appear to be well-defined. However, this code isn't expected to work properly because it does not specify what the event_handler should do when it receives events from the directory observer.

The event handler should define a set of actions to perform when certain events occur, such as when a file is created, modified, or deleted. Therefore, the current implementation must be added.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

## assistant:
There is no syntax error or semantic error in the program. However, there is one issue in the `main()` function:

The line `if not (__name__ == '__main__'):` is causing the `main()` function to not be executed if the code is imported as a module in another program. This means that the `main()` function will only be executed if the script file is executed directly. Therefore, it should be replaced with `if __name__ == '__main__':` to ensure that the `main()` function is executed regardless of how the script file is executed.
