The code itself is not buggy, but it could be improved in terms of readability, modularity and best practices.

For example, the method `_is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple` could be split into smaller methods to make it easier to read and understand. Additionally, the if statements could be simplified by using `isinstance` instead of `type`, and a better option would be to use the `all()` function, which could make the code more concise and easily maintainable. 

And lastly, as the function name suggests that the method is for validation purposes, and if you wanted to modularize this code more, you might want to consider raising an exception if the input value is invalid, instead of returning False. 

Lastly, it seems that the last if statement is meant for testing and should be part of the `if __name__ == '__main__'` block instead of outside of it. 

Here's an improved version of the code that takes some of these suggestions into account: 

```
import numpy

class Validator:
    def is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(self, value):
        '''Determines whether value is a tuple of the format
        (compound(str), mfr(float), temperature(float)).

        :param value: The value to be tested.

        :returns: True or raises an exception if the value is invalid
        '''
        
        if not isinstance(value, tuple) or len(value) != 3:
            raise ValueError("The value must be a tuple with 3 elements")
        
        compound, mfr, temp = value
        if not isinstance(compound, str):
            raise ValueError("The first element of the tuple must be a string")
        if not isinstance(mfr, (float, numpy.float64, numpy.float32)):
            raise ValueError("The second element of the tuple must be a float")
        if not isinstance(temp, (float, numpy.float64, numpy.float32)):
            raise ValueError("The third element of the tuple must be a float")
        
        return True

if __name__ == '__main__':
    validator = Validator()
    test_value_1 = ('compound', 1.2, 3.0)
    test_value_2 = ('compound', 1, 3.0)
    try:
        validator.is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(test_value_1)
        print('Is test_value_1 valid? :', True)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Is test_value_1 valid? : False {e}")
    try:
        validator.is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(test_value_2)
        print('Is test_value_2 valid? :', True)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Is test_value_2 valid? : False {e}")
``` 

This version of the code is more modular, follows best practices and should be more readable and maintainable.

There is no bug in the function `_is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple` itself, but there is a potential problem with the `if __name__ != '__main__'` statement at the end. 

The `if` statement at the end checks whether the current file is being run as the main program or if it is being imported by another program. If it is being run as the main program, then the `main()` function is called. However, if it is being imported by another program, then the `main()` function is not called, and the code does nothing.

This can be a problem if the file is intended to be a library or module that is designed to be imported and used by other programs. In this case, the `main()` function should be moved outside of the `if` statement so that it can be called regardless of how the file is being used.

So to summarize, there is no immediate bug in the code, but there is a potential problem with the use of the `if` statement at the end of the code.
