## assistant:
The code appears to be working and not buggy as such. However, there are a few things that could be improved to ensure better coding practices and performance:

1. In the `wait_for_current_tasks()` method, where there are incomplete tasks, the line `fut.exception()` will always raise an exception if the future is incomplete. Instead, you should use `fut.result()` to wait for the future to complete and then check if it raised an exception.

2. In the `add_task()` method, a new dictionary is created for each task added to the `tasks` list. This could lead to memory issues if a large number of tasks are added. Instead, it would be better to add a tuple with the `future` and `task_id` to the `tasks` list.

3. The `main()` function should not be executed if the code is imported as a module. Therefore, the line `if not (__name__ == '__main__'):` should be removed.

4. It would be useful to add a try-except block in the `add_task()` method to handle any exceptions raised when submitting the task to the executor.

5. The `ThreadPoolExecutor` class could be replaced with the newer `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` class to take advantage of multiprocessing capabilities.

Here is the updated code with these changes implemented:

```python
import logging
import concurrent.futures


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        
        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
        self.tasks = []
        self.task_id = 0
    
    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Add a task to the task list.'''
        try:
            future = self.executor.submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)
            self.tasks.append((future, self.task_id))
            task_id = self.task_id
            self.task_id += 1
            return task_id
        except Exception:
            logger.exception('Failed to submit task')
    
    def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        '''Wait for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
        future to be completed.'''
        logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
        for fut, task_id in self.tasks:
            if not fut.done():
                logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
                fut.result()
            if fut.exception():
                logger.exception('Task {} raised an exception'.format(task_id))
        logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')


def main():
    task_manager = TaskManager()

    for i in range(10):
        task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))

    task_manager.wait_for_current_tasks()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## assistant:
The bug in this code is that `fut.exception()` is used to wait for the future to complete, which is incorrect. 

In the `wait_for_current_tasks()` method, before printing the log 'Waiting for task {} to complete' in the case where `fut.done()` returns False, the statement `fut.exception()` is called. According to the Python documentation for Future objects, calling the `exception()` method on an incomplete future will raise a `concurrent.futures.TimeoutError` exception. 

Therefore, this line should be removed or replaced with `fut.result()`, which blocks until the future is done and returns the result or raises the exception if one occurred. 

Here's the corrected code:

``` python
class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
        self.tasks = {}

    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        future = self.executor.submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        task_id = id(future)
        self.tasks[task_id] = {'app_fu': future}
        return task_id

    def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        '''
        Waits for all tasks in the task list to complete, by waiting for their
        Future object to be completed.

        This method will not wait for any tasks added after cleanup has started
        (such as data stageout?).
        '''
        logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
        for task_id in self.tasks:
            fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
            
            if not fut.done():
                logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
                fut.result()  # Changed from fut.exception(), which is incorrect. 

        logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')
```
