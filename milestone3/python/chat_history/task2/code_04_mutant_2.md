## assistant:
The code seems to be running correctly and does not have any Syntax or TypeErrors. However, there is a logical error in the `wait_for_current_tasks` method.

The `if not ((not (fut.done())))` condition in the method is always going to be True, since the `not (fut.done())` condition returns either `True` or `False`, and applying another `not` negates it back to their original value. Therefore, the `fut.exception()` line will never be executed.

Instead, you can directly call `fut.result()` method on the future object `fut` to wait for its execution to complete and get its result. The code should be updated as follows:

```
def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
    '''Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
    AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
    added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
    '''
    logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
    for task_id in self.tasks:
        
        fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
        if not fut.done():
            logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
            fut.result()
            
    logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')
```

This will correctly wait for all the tasks to complete before returning.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Add a task to the task list.'''
        future = self.executor.submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        task_id = id(future)
        self.tasks[task_id] = {'app_fu': future}

    for i in range(10):
        task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))
    
    
    task_manager.wait_for_current_tasks()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

## assistant:
Yes, the statement involved in the bug is `if not ((not (fut.done()))):` in the `wait_for_current_tasks` method.

This statement tries to check if the future object `fut` is already done by checking if `not fut.done()` is False, but instead of doing it directly, it unnecessarily applies a double negation by doing `not ((not (fut.done())))`, which is logically equivalent to `fut.done()`. Therefore this condition always evaluates to True, and the line `fut.exception()` is called even if the future is already done, which can result in an exception being raised.
