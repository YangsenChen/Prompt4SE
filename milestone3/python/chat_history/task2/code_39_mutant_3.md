Is this code buggy?
def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return (not (self.isBool(type)) and \
        not (self.isString(type)) and \
        self.isNum(type))

## assistant:
The code seems to be okay, However, it requires more context to determine whether it is entirely correct or not. From what I see, the code is a method that takes one parameter 'type', which is a PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS` and returns a boolean value indicating whether it's a byte array value.

The function returns True if the `type` is numeric and not a boolean or a string; otherwise, it returns False. The method uses three other utility methods, `self.isBool()`, `self.isString()`, and `self.isNum()`, to determine the type of `type`.

Without access to the implementations of the `self.isBool()`, `self.isString()`, and `self.isNum()` methods or more information on the overall program's objective, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of this code.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?
def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return (not (self.isBool(type)) and \
        not (self.isString(type)) and \
        self.isNum(type))

## assistant:
Based on the code provided, there are no statements within this function that would seem to be involved in a bug. However, there could be issues in the implementation of the utility methods `self.isBool()`, `self.isString()`, and `self.isNum()` that are called within the `isBin()` method. 

Without knowing the code for those methods, we cannot determine whether they may have potential bugs. Additionally, we may need more context about the code and its objectives to ensure that it is working as expected.
