Is this code buggy?

## assistant:
I don't see any syntax errors or runtime errors in the code that you posted. However, I cannot be sure if the code is functioning correctly as I do not know the context in which it is meant to be used. The `update_apps` method is currently left empty and needs to be implemented by the user. Also, I am not sure if the dependency `appdirs` is installed or not. Overall, the code appears to be incomplete and requires further implementation.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

## assistant:
The statements involved in the bug are hard to identify without knowledge of the context. However, here are some potential issues in the code:

1. The `update_apps` method is not implemented, so there may be issues when it's called in the `getapplist` method.
2. The use of `unicode` to check if the `name` variable is of Unicode type. `unicode` is not a reserved keyword in Python 3.x and might cause NameError, so it's better to use `six.text_type` to check for Unicode compatibility.
3. The try-except block does not have any code in the `except UnicodeEncodeError` block, which might result in potentially unhandled exceptions.
