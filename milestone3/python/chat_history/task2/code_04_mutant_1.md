Is this code buggy?

## assistant:
The code contains a bug. In the `wait_for_current_tasks` method, when a task's future is completed, the exception is called using `fut.exception()`, but that method does not actually raise an exception, it only logs the exception message. To raise the exception, the method `fut.result()` should be called instead. This bug could cause the program to terminate without actually finishing all the tasks if any of them raises an exception during execution.

The corrected `wait_for_current_tasks` method should look like this:

```
def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
    '''Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
    AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
    added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
    '''
    logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
    for task_id in self.tasks:
        fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
        if fut.done():
            logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
            fut.result()
    logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')
```

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

    def __init__(self):

        self.tasks = {}
    
    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Add a task to the task list.'''

        task_id = id(future)
        self.tasks[task_id] = {'app_fu': future}
        return task_id
    
    def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        '''Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their

        for task_id in self.tasks:
            
            
            fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
            if fut.done():
                logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))

    for i in range(10):
        task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))
    
    
    task_manager.wait_for_current_tasks()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

## assistant:
Yes, the statements involved in the bug are:

```
if fut.done():
    logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
    fut.exception()
```

The `fut.exception()` statement is used to log an error message for an exception that occurred in the task's future, but this does not actually raise the exception. The correct statement to raise the exception is `fut.result()`.
