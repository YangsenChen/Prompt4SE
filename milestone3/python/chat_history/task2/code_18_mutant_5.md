Is this code buggy?

def stop(ctx, yes):
    '''Stop experiment.

    Uses [Caching](/references/polyaxon-cli/#caching)

    Examples:

    \x08
    ```bash
    $ polyaxon experiment stop
    ```

    \x08
    ```bash
    $ polyaxon experiment -xp 2 stop
    ```
    '''
    (user, project_name, _experiment) = get_project_experiment_or_local(ctx.obj.get('project'), 
        ctx.obj.get('experiment'))
    if (not yes or not (click.confirm('Are sure you want to stop experiment `{}`'.format(
        _experiment)))):
        click.echo('Existing without stopping experiment.')
        sys.exit(0)
    
    
    PolyaxonClient().experiment.stop(user, project_name, _experiment)
    
    
    Printer.print_success('Experiment is being stopped.')

def main():
    ctx = dict()
    ctx['project'] = 'your_project_name'
    ctx['experiment'] = 'your_experiment_id'
    yes = True
    stop(ctx, yes)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

## assistant:
The code seems to be fine in terms of syntax and semantics at a first glance. But there are few things that could be improved.

1. The code imports `PolyaxonClient` and `Printer` modules, but there is no explanation of where they come from. 
2. The way `get_project_experiment_or_local()` function is called suggests that it might be a custom function defined somewhere else, but it is not present in this script.
3. It is not clear what the purpose of `main()` function is. It does not receive any input or return any output and simply calls the `stop()` function.
4. The documentation in the docstring of `stop()` function is indented and contains extra lines, which might cause formatting issues in certain scenarios.
5. The name of the variable `yes` is confusing as it is not clear what it refers to and how it is used.

These are not necessarily errors or bugs in the code, but they could be improved for better clarity and readability.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

## assistant:
The three statements that might be involved in the bug are not present in this script. These statements include:

- `get_project_experiment_or_local()` function with an unknown implementation.
- `PolyaxonClient()` class constructor with an unknown implementation.
- `Printer.print_success()` method with an unknown implementation.

Without the implementation details of these statements, it is hard to determine whether they contain any bug or not.
