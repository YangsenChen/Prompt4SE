Is this code buggy?

































import sys
import click






def stop(ctx, yes):
    '''Stop experiment.

    Uses [Caching](/references/polyaxon-cli/#caching)

    Examples:

    \x08
    ```bash
    $ polyaxon experiment stop
    ```

    \x08
    ```bash
    $ polyaxon experiment -xp 2 stop
    ```
    '''
    (user, project_name, _experiment) = get_project_experiment_or_local(ctx.obj.get('project'), 
        ctx.obj.get('experiment'))
    if (not yes and not (click.confirm('Are sure you want to stop experiment `{}`'.format(
        _experiment)))):
        click.echo('Existing without stopping experiment.')
        sys.exit(0)
    
    
    PolyaxonClient().experiment.stop(user, project_name, _experiment)
    
    
    Printer.print_success('Experiment is being stopped.')

def main():
    ctx = dict()
    ctx['project'] = 'your_project_name'
    ctx['experiment'] = 'your_experiment_id'
    yes = True
    stop(ctx, yes)

if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()

## assistant:
The code appears to have some indentation issues, but assuming that is corrected, it seems that the `get_project_experiment_or_local` function is undefined and potentially causing an error. Additionally, the `PolyaxonClient()` function is called without arguments, which may also cause an error. 

If these issues are resolved in the rest of the code, it should work as intended.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

## assistant:
Yes, there are several statements involved in the bug:

1. `get_project_experiment_or_local` is called, but it is undefined and the code does not define how to get it.
2. `PolyaxonClient()` is called without any arguments, which typically requires some arguments to function properly.
3. The last line of the code (`if not (__name__ == '__main__'):`) checks if the code is being imported and then calls the main function (`main()`) outside of the main block. This could cause issues if this module is imported by another module because `main()` would be executed immediately upon import. The last two lines should be indented into the main block to fix this error.
