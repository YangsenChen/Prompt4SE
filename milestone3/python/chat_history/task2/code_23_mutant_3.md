Is this code buggy?

                assert self._observer is not None

                self._running = True
    
    def setup_observer(self, directory, event_handler):
        '''
        Sets up the observer to monitor the directory with the given event handler.
        '''
        self._observer.schedule(event_handler, directory, recursive=True)

def main():
    import sys
    from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
    
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print('Usage: python script.py [directory_to_monitor]')
        return
    
    directory_to_monitor = sys.argv[1]
    
    monitor = DirectoryMonitor()
    event_handler = FileSystemEventHandler()
    monitor.setup_observer(directory_to_monitor, event_handler)
    monitor.start()
    
    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        monitor.stop()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

## assistant:
The code is not necessarily buggy, but it could be improved. Here are a couple of things to consider:

1. The main function includes a "try" statement with no except or finally blocks, which means that the program will terminate abruptly upon a keyboard interruption (i.e., Ctrl+C). Therefore, it would be better to include a KeyboardInterrupt handler that performs any necessary cleanup, such as stopping the observer.

2. The condition "if not ((not (self._running)))" could be simplified to "if not self._running". 

3. The observer is not instantiated before it is used in the setup_observer method, which could lead to an AttributeError. It would be better to initialize the observer in the constructor.

4. The code assumes that the user will always provide a directory to monitor as a command-line argument. It would be better to include a check that ensures that the directory exists.

5. The use of the assert statement in the stop method should be avoided, as it can be disabled with the -O switch to the interpreter. Instead, use an if statement to handle the error condition.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

## assistant:
The code appears to have two potential issues that could be considered bugs:

1. In the start method, the condition "if not ((not (self._running)))" is more complex than necessary. It could be simplified to "if not self._running", which would make the code easier to read and understand.

2. In the stop method, the assert statement is used to check if _observer is not None. If _observer is None, then an AttributeError will be raised. It would be better to use an if statement to check if _observer is None before calling its stop method.
