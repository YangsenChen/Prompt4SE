Is this code buggy?
























from appdirs import unicode


class AccessibleApps:
    def __init__(self):
        self._running_apps = []
    
    def _update_apps(self):
        
        pass
    
    def getapplist(self):
        '''
        Get all accessibility application names that are currently running

        @return: list of application names of string type on success.
        @rtype: list
        '''
        app_list = []
        
        self._update_apps()
        for gui in self._running_apps:
            name = gui.localizedName()
            
            
            
            try:
                name = unicode(name)
            except NameError:
                name = str(name)
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
            app_list.append(name)
        
        return list(set(app_list))


def main():
    accessible_apps = AccessibleApps()
    app_list = accessible_apps.getapplist()
    print('Accessible applications:', app_list)


if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()

## assistant:
The code itself doesn't seem to have syntax errors, but it relies on some external packages that may or may not be installed. Specifically, it imports the `appdirs` library, which is not a built-in library and needs to be installed separately.

Also, the `unicode` function that is imported from `appdirs` is not used in the code and is redundant.

Lastly, there is an if-statement at the end checking if the script is being executed as the main program. This is a standard Python idiom that is used to avoid running a particular piece of code when a module is imported as a library. If this script is intended to be used as a module, this if-statement can be removed.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

## assistant:
There are no apparent logical errors in the code. However, the statement `from appdirs import unicode` is not needed and is redundant as it is never used in the rest of the code. Additionally, it looks like there are no statements in the `_update_apps` method and it needs to be filled with the code to populate the `_running_apps` list.
