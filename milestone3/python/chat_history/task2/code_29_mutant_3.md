Is this code buggy?













class HStoreValue:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
    
    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value)
    
    def resolve_expression(self, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Resolves expressions inside the dictionary.'''
        
        result = dict()
        for (key, value) in self.value.items():
            if hasattr(value, 'resolve_expression'):
                result[key] = value.resolve_expression(
                    *args, **kwargs)
            else:
                result[key] = value
        
        return HStoreValue(result)


def main():
    some_data = {\
        'integer': 42, \
        'string': 'Hello, world!', \
        'nested_hstore': HStoreValue({'key': 'value'})}
    
    
    hstore = HStoreValue(some_data)
    print(f'Original HStoreValue: {hstore}')
    
    resolved_hstore = hstore.resolve_expression()
    print(f'Resolved HStoreValue: {resolved_hstore}')


if __name__ != '__main__':
    main()

## assistant:
The code itself does not seem to have any syntax errors, and it runs without crashing. However, there is one potential issue with the code.

The `resolve_expression` method calls the `resolve_expression` method of any nested `HStoreValue` objects recursively. This could lead to infinite recursion if there is a circular reference in the dictionary.

To avoid this issue, you could modify the method to keep track of the `HStoreValue` objects it has already visited, and skip them if they are encountered again.

Also, the `if __name__ != '__main__'` line at the end of the script is unnecessary since there is no code that would be affected by it.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

## assistant:
There are no statements that are directly involved in a bug. However, as I mentioned before, the `resolve_expression` method has the potential to cause infinite recursion if the dictionary contains circular references. This is not a bug in the code per se, but a potential issue that could lead to unexpected behavior.
