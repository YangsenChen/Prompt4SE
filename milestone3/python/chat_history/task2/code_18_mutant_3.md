Is this code buggy?

































import sys
import click






def stop(ctx, yes):
    '''Stop experiment.

    Uses [Caching](/references/polyaxon-cli/#caching)

    Examples:

    \x08
    ```bash
    $ polyaxon experiment stop
    ```

    \x08
    ```bash
    $ polyaxon experiment -xp 2 stop
    ```
    '''
    (user, project_name, _experiment) = get_project_experiment_or_local(ctx.obj.get('project'), 
        ctx.obj.get('experiment'))
    if not ((not yes and not (click.confirm('Are sure you want to stop experiment `{}`'.format(
        _experiment))))):
        click.echo('Existing without stopping experiment.')
        sys.exit(0)
    
    
    PolyaxonClient().experiment.stop(user, project_name, _experiment)
    
    
    Printer.print_success('Experiment is being stopped.')

def main():
    ctx = dict()
    ctx['project'] = 'your_project_name'
    ctx['experiment'] = 'your_experiment_id'
    yes = True
    stop(ctx, yes)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

## assistant:
The code does not seem to have syntax errors, but it depends on other modules to run correctly, like "get_project_experiment_or_local" function that is not defined within the script and may generate errors. It also depends on click and PolyaxonClient modules to be installed and working properly, which are not verified in the script. Furthermore, the `stop()` function accepts a 'yes' parameter even though it is always set to True in the main function. This parameter seems to be pointless since it is never used in the code.

Lastly, the `Printer` module is not defined in the script. It is uncertain whether it is defined in the imported modules or not.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

## assistant:
The statements `get_project_experiment_or_local(ctx.obj.get('project'), ctx.obj.get('experiment'))` and `PolyaxonClient().experiment.stop(user, project_name, _experiment)` are involved in the bug since they are dependent on external modules and functions that are not defined in this script, and might generate errors. Also, the `Printer` module is not defined, which raises questions about the functionality of the `print_success()` method. Finally, the `yes` parameter in the `stop()` function is not used, making it pointless to pass it with the parameters in the `main()` function.
