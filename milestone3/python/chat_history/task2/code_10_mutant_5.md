## assistant:
The code looks incomplete. It seems that the function `Grids.SparseToRegularGrid()` is not defined, so it will raise an exception in the `Mapper.image_plane_pix_grid_from_regular_grid()` method. 

Also, there seems to be an issue with the calculation of `pixel_scales`, where integer division (`//`) is used for the `y` scale instead of normal division (`/`). 

Furthermore, it is not clear what the `Grids` class does and why it is being imported but not used in the code. Finally, it would be helpful to include a brief description of what this code is supposed to do.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

## assistant:
Yes, there is a bug located in the `pixel_scales` calculation statement. Specifically, on the `y` scale calculation, normal division (`/`) should also be used instead of integer division (`//`). 

The corrected version of the statement is as follows: 

`pixel_scales = ((regular_grid.masked_shape_arcsec[0] + pixel_scale) / self.shape[0], (regular_grid.masked_shape_arcsec[1] + pixel_scale) / self.shape[1])`
