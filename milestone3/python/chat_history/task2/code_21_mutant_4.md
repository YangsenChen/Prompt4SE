## assistant:
I don't see any obvious bugs in the code because it's not raising any syntax errors. However, the `_get_object_handle` function is not returning a meaningful object handle but is returning a fixed dictionary, which could be an issue that needs to be taken care of in the future implementation. Also, I think the condition `if not (__name__ == '__main__')` is redundant because that's how the entry point of the application is defined in Python.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

## assistant:
There is no syntax error or logical bugs in this code. However, one minor issue is that in the `setcursorposition` method, it directly modifies the `object_handle` dictionary. If `object_handle` is also used elsewhere in the code, this modification could have unintended consequences on the rest of the code. It would be better to create a copy of `object_handle`, modify the copy, and return the copy instead. Another potential issue is that the `_get_object_handle` method always returns the same hard-coded dictionary, which may not be appropriate. Finally, the `if not (__name__ == '__main__'):` line is useless because it should always evaluate to `True` in this file.
