Is this code buggy?








from io import StringIO

class CustomStringIO:
    def __init__(self):
        self.content = 'Some text that will be dumped into StringIO.'
    
    def _string(self):
        ''':return: the string from a :class:`io.StringIO`'''
        file = StringIO()
        self.__dump_to_file(file)
        file.seek(0)
        return file.read()
    
    def __dump_to_file(self, file):
        '''Dumps the content to a file-like object.'''
        file.write(self.content)

def main():
    custom_string_io = CustomStringIO()
    result = custom_string_io._string()
    print('String from StringIO:', result)

if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()

## assistant:
No, the code doesn't seem to be buggy. However, the use of two underscores in `__dump_to_file` method suggests that the method is intended to be private, but not completely hidden from the user, since it is used within the class in `_string` method. In this case, a single underscore should have been used to indicate that the method is intended to be private. Also, the condition `if not (__name__ == '__main__'):` is not necessary if all the top-level code is put into a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

## assistant:
There are no statements involved in the bug in this code. However, it would be better to modify the code to follow the standard Python coding conventions, for example, by using a single underscore prefix for internal methods (such as `_dump_to_file` instead of `__dump_to_file`). Additionally, the condition at the end of the code (`if not (__name__ == '__main__'):`) is unnecessary since the `main()` function is called only when the script is executed as the main program. It would be better to use the standard idiom `if __name__ == '__main__':` to ensure that the code inside the `if` statement is executed only when the script is run as the main program.
