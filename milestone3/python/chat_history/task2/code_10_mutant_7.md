## assistant:
I don't see any obvious errors in the code. However, there is some code that is not being executed because the `main()` function is called only when the script is run as the main program (i.e., `__name__ == '__main__'`). Since this is a module, if someone were to import this code as a module, the `main()` function would not be executed.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

## assistant:
There is no specific bug in this code, but there is an unnecessary check at the end that prevents the `main()` function from being executed when the code is imported as a module. Since `main()` function is the only code block that is executed, this check is redundant and may confuse those who import this code. The correct way to write the code is to remove the if-check at the end of the code and just keep the `main()` function.
