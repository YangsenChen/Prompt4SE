No, the code is not buggy, but the code of the `_get_object_handle` method does not seem to be complete. It just returns a constant dictionary without any reference to the window_name and object_name parameters. In addition, the `__init__` methods of the two classes are empty and do not initialize anything, which may not be a problem but may be a sign of incomplete code.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

## assistant:
Yes, there is a bug in the code. When trying to set the cursor position, the following statement is involved in the bug:

```
object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange']['loc'] = cursor_position
```

This line of code tries to modify the value of the 'loc' key in the 'AXSelectedTextRange' dictionary, which throws a `TypeError` in Python because the dictionary is not mutable. The correct way to modify the dictionary would be to create a new dictionary and assign it to the same 'AXSelectedTextRange' key in the `object_handle` dictionary.

For example, a correct statement would be:

```
object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange'] = {'loc': cursor_position}
```
