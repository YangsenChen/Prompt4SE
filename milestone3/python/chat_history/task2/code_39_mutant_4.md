Is this code buggy?
def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return (not (self.isBool(type)) or \
        not (self.isString(type)) or \
        not (self.isNum(type)))

## assistant:
The code may have a bug in the function's logic. 

The function isBin() intends to check whether a given "type" input is a binary array or not. However, the current implementation does not seem to follow that logic. The function checks if "type" is not a boolean, not a string, or not numeric, and returns a boolean value based on the result of these checks. 

This implementation would return True for any input that is not a boolean, not a string, or not a number. Therefore, even if the input is not binary, the function would still return True if it is not one of the types specified in the function. 

To ensure the function works as intended, the code should be revised as follows:

```
def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return isinstance(type, bytes)
```

This implementation checks if the "type" input is of bytes data type and returns True if it is.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?
def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return (not (self.isBool(type)) or \
        not (self.isString(type)) or \
        not (self.isNum(type)))

## assistant:
Yes, the statements involved in the bug are:

```
not (self.isBool(type)) 
not (self.isString(type)) 
not (self.isNum(type))
```

These statements are used to check if the input parameter "type" is not a boolean, a string, or a number. However, these checks are incorrect for the purpose of determining whether the variable is a "byte array" or not. 

Due to the use of the `or` operator, the function returns True even if any one of the checks is True. This means that if "type" is not a boolean, or if it's not a string, or if it's not a number, the function will return True even if the actual value of "type" is not a byte array.
