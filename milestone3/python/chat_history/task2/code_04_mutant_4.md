## assistant:
There does not seem to be any syntax errors or typos in the code you provided. However, there may be some logical errors depending on the expected behavior of the program. Here are a few points:

1. The `future.exception()` call in the `wait_for_current_tasks()` method doesn't seem to serve any purpose. This method should wait for all tasks to complete, not raise an exception if there is one. Instead, you can replace it with `fut.result()`, which will wait for the task to complete and return its result.
2. The `range()` function called with `i` as argument will yield values from 0 to i-1. If the intent is to calculate the sum of the first `i` integers, the call should be `range(i+1)`.
3. It's not clear what the purpose of the `TaskManager` class is. It seems to just add a layer over the concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor class.

Other than that, the code looks fine.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?

        self.tasks = {}
    
    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Add a task to the task list.'''

## assistant:
The code does not have any syntax errors or typos, but there is a logical error in the `wait_for_current_tasks()` method. Instead of waiting for the tasks to complete, it raises an exception using `fut.exception()`, which is not necessary and can mask the actual errors. The line should be changed to `fut.result()`, which will wait for the task to complete and return its result.

Therefore, the statement involved in the bug is:

```
fut.exception()
```
