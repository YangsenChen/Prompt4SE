Yes, there seem to be a few issues with this code:

1. In the `Mapper` class, the second component of `pixel_scales` is calculated incorrectly. It should be divided by the shape's second component instead of being multiplied by it. The correct line of code should be:
```
pixel_scales = (
    (regular_grid.masked_shape_arcsec[0] + pixel_scale) / self.shape[0],
    (regular_grid.masked_shape_arcsec[1] + pixel_scale) / self.shape[1]
)
```

2. The `Grids` class is defined, but not imported or used anywhere in the code. It can be safely removed.

3. The `Grids.SparseToRegularGrid` method is called in `Mapper.image_plane_pix_grid_from_regular_grid`, but it is not defined anywhere in the code. This is likely a dependency from another package that has not been imported.

Fixing these issues should make the code run correctly.

Yes, there are a few statements involved in the bug:

1. In the `Mapper` class, the calculation for the `pixel_scales` variable is incorrect and is causing the bug. This line of code should be corrected as follows:
```
pixel_scales = (
    (regular_grid.masked_shape_arcsec[0] + pixel_scale) / self.shape[0],
    (regular_grid.masked_shape_arcsec[1] + pixel_scale) / self.shape[1]
)
```
The second component of `pixel_scales` should be divided by `self.shape[1]`, instead of being multiplied by it.

2. The `Grids.SparseToRegularGrid()` method is being called in the `image_plane_pix_grid_from_regular_grid` method, but it is not defined in the code. This suggests that it is a missing external dependency.

Fixing these statements should resolve the issues with this code.
