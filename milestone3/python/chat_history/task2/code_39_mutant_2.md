Is this code buggy?
def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return (not (self.isBool(type)) and \
        self.isString(type) and \
        not (self.isNum(type)))

## assistant:
Based only on the code you provided, it's impossible to say whether this code is buggy or not because it references three functions that are not shown (`isBool`, `isString` and `isNum`). Therefore, it is unclear what kind of input is expected and what kind of output will be returned for the `type` parameter passed to this function. 

If you can provide more information about those functions, I can update my reply with a more informed judgement.

Can you spot the statements involved in the bug?
def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return (not (self.isBool(type)) and \
        self.isString(type) and \
        not (self.isNum(type)))

## assistant:
Based solely on the code provided, there don't appear to be any syntax errors, but there could be issues with the code logic, depending on what is returned by the `isBool`, `isString`, and `isNum` functions.

If the `isBool` function returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the `type` parameter is a boolean data type, and if the `isString` function returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the `type` parameter is a string data type, and if the `isNum` function returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the `type` parameter is a numeric data type, then the code seems correct on the surface.

However, without more information about what these other functions do and what the expected input/output of the `type` parameter are, it is difficult to say for certain whether any of the statements are involved in a bug.
