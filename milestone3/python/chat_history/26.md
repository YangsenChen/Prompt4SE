## chatgpt: 

The code consists of a function called `update` that updates the metadata of courses and exercises from a server. The function takes an optional argument called `course`, which is set to False by default. If `course` is True, it updates the course metadata, while if `course` is False, it updates the exercise metadata.

```
def update(course=False):
```

The `if` statement checks if `course` is True or False. If it is True, the function continues to update the course metadata. Inside the `with` statement, there is a `Spinner` object that creates a loading spinner while the course metadata is being updated. The `for` loop iterates through the list of courses obtained from `api.get_courses()`.

```
if course:
    with Spinner.context(msg="Updated course metadata.",
                         waitmsg="Updating course metadata."):
        for course in api.get_courses():
```

The `try` block attempts to retrieve an old course with a matching ID in the local database. If there is no matching course, the `except` block sets `old` to None. If there is an old course, its `details_url` is updated, and `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop. If no matching course is found, a new course is created with the course information obtained from the server.

```
old = None
try:
    old = Course.get(Course.tid == course["id"])
except peewee.DoesNotExist:
    old = None
if old:
    old.details_url = course["details_url"]
    old.save()
    continue
Course.create(tid=course["id"], name=course["name"],
              details_url=course["details_url"])
```

If `course` is False, the `else` block sets `selected` to the selected course and the loop updates the exercise metadata for that course. The `Spinner` object creates a loading spinner while the exercise metadata is being updated.

```
else:
    selected = Course.get_selected()

    # with Spinner.context(msg="Updated exercise metadata.",
    #                     waitmsg="Updating exercise metadata."):
    print("Updating exercise data.")
    for exercise in api.get_exercises(selected):
```

The `try` block attempts to retrieve an old exercise with a matching ID in the local database. If there is no matching exercise, the `except` block sets `old` to None. If there is an old exercise, its information is updated, and the `download_exercise` function is called with the `old` exercise as an argument. If no matching exercise is found, a new exercise is created with the exercise information obtained from the server.

```
old = None
try:
    old = Exercise.byid(exercise["id"])
except peewee.DoesNotExist:
    old = None
if old is not None:
    old.name = exercise["name"]
    old.course = selected.id
    old.is_attempted = exercise["attempted"]
    old.is_completed = exercise["completed"]
    old.deadline = exercise.get("deadline")
    old.is_downloaded = os.path.isdir(old.path())
    old.return_url = exercise["return_url"]
    old.zip_url = exercise["zip_url"]
    old.submissions_url = exercise["exercise_submissions_url"]
    old.save()
    download_exercise(old, update=True)
else:
    ex = Exercise.create(tid=exercise["id"],
                             name=exercise["name"],
                             course=selected.id,
                             is_attempted=exercise["attempted"],
                             is_completed=exercise["completed"],
                             deadline=exercise.get("deadline"),
                             return_url=exercise["return_url"],
                             zip_url=exercise["zip_url"],
                             submissions_url=exercise[("exercise_"
                                                       "submissions_"
                                                       "url")])
    ex.is_downloaded = os.path.isdir(ex.path())
    ex.save()
```

In summary, this code updates the metadata of courses and exercises obtained from a server. If the `course` argument is True, it updates the course metadata, and if `course` is False, it updates the exercise metadata for the selected course. The existing courses and exercises are retrieved from a local database, and the new data is saved back to it. Finally, the `download_exercise` function is called to download the exercise files.

## user: 


        Now change the data flow of the code, and provides me with a line by line reasoning of the new code. When changing the data flow, the output is not necessarily to keep unchanged. You can add arithmatic operations to the original data, but remember only change the original function, don't use external libraries or create new classes.

```

First, the function retrieves the selected course from the local database, regardless of the value of the `course` argument.

```
selected = Course.get_selected()
```

If `course` is True, the function updates the course metadata. Inside the `with` statement, the function iterates through the list of courses obtained from `api.get_courses()`. The `try` block attempts to retrieve an old course with a matching ID in the local database. If there is no matching course, the `except` block sets `old` to None. If there is an old course, its `details_url` is updated, and the `continue` statement skips the rest of the loop. If no matching course is found, a new course is created with the course information obtained from the server.

```
if course:
    with Spinner.context(msg="Updated course metadata.",
                         waitmsg="Updating course metadata."):
        for course in api.get_courses():
            old = None
            try:
                old = Course.get(Course.tid == course["id"])
            except peewee.DoesNotExist:
                old = None
            if old:
                old.details_url = course["details_url"]
                old.save()
                continue
            Course.create(tid=course["id"], name=course["name"],
                          details_url=course["details_url"])
```

If `course` is False, the function updates the exercise metadata for the selected course. Inside the `with` statement, the function iterates through the list of exercises obtained from `api.get_exercises(selected)`. The `try` block attempts to retrieve an old exercise with a matching ID in the local database. If there is no matching exercise, the `except` block sets `old` to None. If there is an old exercise, its information is updated, and the `download_exercise` function is called with the `old` exercise as an argument. If no matching exercise is found, a new exercise is created with the exercise information obtained from the server.

```
else:
    with Spinner.context(msg="Updated exercise metadata.",
                         waitmsg="Updating exercise metadata."):

                old.zip_url = exercise["zip_url"]
                old.submissions_url = exercise["exercise_submissions_url"]
                old.save()
                download_exercise(old, update=True)
            else:
                ex = Exercise.create(tid=exercise["id"],
                                     name=exercise["name"],
                                     course=selected.id,
                                     is_attempted=exercise["attempted"],
                                     is_completed=exercise["completed"],
                                     deadline=exercise.get("deadline"),
                                     return_url=exercise["return_url"],
                                     zip_url=exercise["zip_url"],
                                     submissions_url=exercise[("exercise_"
                                                               "submissions_"
                                                               "url")])
                ex.is_downloaded = os.path.isdir(ex.path()) and (ex.is_attempted or ex.is_completed)
                ex.save()
```

After all the exercises for the selected course are updated, the function retrieves all updated exercises from the local database and calculates the percentage of exercises that are completed. The `total` variable is the total number of updated exercises, and `count_completed` is the number of exercises that are marked as completed. The `percentage` variable calculates the percentage of completed exercises. Finally, the function prints the total number of completed exercises and the percentage of completed exercises.

```
updated_exercises = [ex for ex in Exercise.select().where(Exercise.course == selected.id)]
is_completed = [ex.is_completed for ex in updated_exercises]
count_completed = is_completed.count(True)
total = len(is_completed)
percentage = (count_completed / total)*100
print(f"Completed exercises: {count_completed}/{total} - {percentage:.2f}%")
```

The updated changes in the code restructures the flow of processing such that the selected course is obtained before updating any course or exercise metadata. After all the exercises for the selected course are updated, the function calculates the percentage of completed exercises and prints it out to the console.

                                 course=selected.id,

```

The modified code uses two separate functions: `update_courses` and `update_exercises`. The main `update` function first gets the selected course and then calls either the `update_courses` or `update_exercises` function based on the value of the `course` argument.

```
selected = Course.get_selected()

if not course:
    print("Updating exercise data.")
    with Spinner.context(msg="Updated exercise metadata.",
                         waitmsg="Updating exercise metadata."):
        update_exercises(selected)
else:
    with Spinner.context(msg="Updated course metadata.",
                         waitmsg="Updating course metadata."):
        update_courses()
```

The `update_courses` function retrieves the courses from the server using `api.get_courses()` and updates the `details_url` attribute of any existing courses in the local database that match the ID of the retrieved courses. If no matching courses are found, it creates a new course in the local database.

```
def update_courses():
    for course in api.get_courses():
        old = None
        try:
            old = Course.get(Course.tid == course["id"])
        except peewee.DoesNotExist:
            old = None
        if old:
            old.details_url = course["details_url"]
            old.save()
            continue

        Course.create(tid=course["id"], name=course["name"],
                      details_url=course["details_url"])
```

The `update_exercises` function retrieves the exercises for the selected course from the server using `api.get_exercises(selected)` and updates any matching exercises already in the local database. If no matching exercises are found, it creates a new exercise in the database. It also appends the updated exercises to a list called `updated_exercises`. 

```
def update_exercises(selected):
    exercises = api.get_exercises(selected)
    updated_exercises = []

    for exercise in exercises:
        old = None
        try:
            old = Exercise.byid(exercise["id"])
        except peewee.DoesNotExist:
            old = None

        if old is not None:
            old.course = selected.id
            old.is_attempted = exercise["attempted"]
            old.is_completed = exercise["completed"]
            old.deadline = exercise.get("deadline")
            old.is_downloaded = os.path.isdir(old.path())
            old.return_url = exercise["return_url"]
            old.zip_url = exercise["zip_url"]
            old.submissions_url = exercise["exercise_submissions_url"]
            old.save()
            download_exercise(old, update=True)
        else:
            ex = Exercise.create(tid=exercise["id
