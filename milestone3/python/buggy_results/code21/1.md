Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            





















class LdtpServerException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, exception_message):
        super().__init__(exception_message)


class ChatGPT:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def _get_object_handle(self, window_name, object_name):
        
        
        return {'AXEnabled': True, 'AXSelectedTextRange': {'loc': 0}}
    
    def setcursorposition(self, window_name, object_name, cursor_position):
        """
                Set cursor position

                @param window_name: Window name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.
                @type window_name: string
                @param object_name: Object name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.
                @type object_name: string
                @param cursor_position: Cursor position to be set
                @type cursor_position: integer

                @return: 1 on success.
                @rtype: integer
                """
        object_handle = self._get_object_handle(window_name, object_name)
        if not (object_handle['AXEnabled']):
            raise LdtpServerException('Object %s state disabled' * object_name)
        object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange']['loc'] = cursor_position
        return 1


def main():
    window_name = 'sample_window'
    object_name = 'sample_object'
    cursor_position = 5
    
    chat_gpt = ChatGPT()
    result = chat_gpt.setcursorposition(window_name, object_name, cursor_position)
    print(f'Result: {result}')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

There are two bugs in the given Python code:
1. The exception message is not formatted correctly. In the `setcursorposition` function, the raise statement should have `%s` inside the string to format the object name, but it is placed outside the string. This should be corrected as follows:
```
        raise LdtpServerException('Object %s state disabled' % object_name)
```
2. The `_get_object_handle` function returns a dictionary containing the `AXSelectedTextRange` key, which is mutable. The function then modifies the contents of the returned dictionary by changing the value of the `AXSelectedTextRange` key. As dictionaries are mutable objects in Python, the returned value can be changed elsewhere, leading to unexpected behavior. To avoid this, a new copy of the dictionary should be returned in `_get_object_handle` as follows:
```
        return {'AXEnabled': True, 'AXSelectedTextRange': {'loc': 0}}.copy()
```

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            





















class LdtpServerException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, exception_message):
        super().__init__(exception_message)

    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def _get_object_handle(self, window_name, object_name):
        
        
        return {'AXEnabled': True, 'AXSelectedTextRange': {'loc': 0}}
    
    def setcursorposition(self, window_name, object_name, cursor_position):
        """
                Set cursor position

                @param window_name: Window name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.
                @type window_name: string
                @param object_name: Object name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.

                @type cursor_position: integer

                @return: 1 on success.

        object_handle = self._get_object_handle(window_name, object_name)

            raise LdtpServerException('Object %s state disabled' * object_name)
        object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange']['loc'] = cursor_position
        return 1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

The following lines of code contain bugs:

1. The exception message is incorrectly formatted. The `raise` statement in the `setcursorposition` function should include `%s` inside the string to format the object name, but it is placed outside the string. This should be corrected as follows:
```
raise LdtpServerException(f'Object {object_name} state disabled')
```
2. The function `_get_object_handle` returns a mutable dictionary containing the `AXSelectedTextRange` key, which is modified in the `setcursorposition` function. This can cause unexpected behavior. To avoid this, a new dictionary should be created and returned in `_get_object_handle` as follows:
```
return {'AXEnabled': True, 'AXSelectedTextRange': {'loc': 0}}.copy()
```
