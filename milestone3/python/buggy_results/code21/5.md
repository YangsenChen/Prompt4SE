Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            





















class LdtpServerException(Exception):
    pass



class ChatGPT:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def _get_object_handle(self, window_name, object_name):
        
        
        return {'AXEnabled': True, 'AXSelectedTextRange': {'loc': 0}}
    
    def setcursorposition(self, window_name, object_name, cursor_position):
        """
                Set cursor position

                @param window_name: Window name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.
                @type window_name: string
                @param object_name: Object name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.
                @type object_name: string
                @param cursor_position: Cursor position to be set
                @type cursor_position: integer

                @return: 1 on success.
                @rtype: integer
                """
        object_handle = self._get_object_handle(window_name, object_name)
        if not (object_handle['AXEnabled']):
            raise LdtpServerException('Object %s state disabled' % object_name)
        object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange']['loc'] = cursor_position
        return 1


def main():
    window_name = 'sample_window'
    object_name = 'sample_object'
    cursor_position = 5
    
    chat_gpt = ChatGPT()
    result = chat_gpt.setcursorposition(window_name, object_name, cursor_position)
    print(f'Result: {result}')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```
            

## chatgpt: 

The code has logical issues but it is not a bug. The `_get_object_handle` function isn't implemented properly. It returns a dictionary object having `AXEnabled` and `AXSelectedTextRange` keys which is not useful to set cursor position. Additionally, setting cursor position with a dictionary object is not possible.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            





















class LdtpServerException(Exception):
    pass

    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def _get_object_handle(self, window_name, object_name):
        
        
        return {'AXEnabled': True, 'AXSelectedTextRange': {'loc': 0}}
    
    def setcursorposition(self, window_name, object_name, cursor_position):
        """
                Set cursor position

                @param window_name: Window name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.
                @type window_name: string
                @param object_name: Object name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.

                @type cursor_position: integer

                @return: 1 on success.
                @rtype: integer
                """
        object_handle = self._get_object_handle(window_name, object_name)
        if not (object_handle['AXEnabled']):
            raise LdtpServerException('Object %s state disabled' % object_name)
        object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange']['loc'] = cursor_position
        return 1

    window_name = 'sample_window'
    object_name = 'sample_object'
    cursor_position = 5

    result = chat_gpt.setcursorposition(window_name, object_name, cursor_position)
    print(f'Result: {result}')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, there is a bug in the code. In the `setcursorposition` method, the statement `object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange']['loc'] = cursor_position` will not set the cursor position as dictionary objects are immutable in Python. Therefore, a new dictionary object should be created and returned from `_get_object_handle()` function to update the cursor position.
