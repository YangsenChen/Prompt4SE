Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            





















class LdtpServerException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, exception_message):
        super().__init__(exception_message)


class ChatGPT:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def _get_object_handle(self, window_name, object_name):
        
        
        return {'AXEnabled': True, 'AXSelectedTextRange': {'loc': 0}}
    
    def setcursorposition(self, window_name, object_name, cursor_position):
        """
                Set cursor position

                @param window_name: Window name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.
                @type window_name: string
                @param object_name: Object name to type in, either full name,

                @param cursor_position: Cursor position to be set
                @type cursor_position: integer

                @return: 1 on success.
                @rtype: integer
                """
        object_handle = self._get_object_handle(window_name, object_name)
        if object_handle['AXEnabled']:
            raise LdtpServerException('Object %s state disabled' % object_name)
        object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange']['loc'] = cursor_position
        return 1


def main():
    window_name = 'sample_window'
    object_name = 'sample_object'
    cursor_position = 5
    
    chat_gpt = ChatGPT()
    result = chat_gpt.setcursorposition(window_name, object_name, cursor_position)
    print(f'Result: {result}')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, there is a bug in the code. 

In the `_get_object_handle()` method, the implementation always returns the same dictionary object: `{'AXEnabled': True, 'AXSelectedTextRange': {'loc': 0}}`. The dictionary returned does not depend on the input arguments of the method. This is likely not intended and makes the returned dictionary not useful for the purpose of setting the cursor position. 

Later on, in the `setcursorposition()` method, the code checks if the value of `AXEnabled` is True, and if so raises an exception. Since the value of `AXEnabled` is always True due to the bug in `_get_object_handle()`, the exception will always be raised, making it impossible to ever set the cursor position. Therefore, the method does not work as intended.

In addition, there's one extra indention level for the docstring of setcursorposition, but that is a minor issue.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python

        return {'AXEnabled': True, 'AXSelectedTextRange': {'loc': 0}}
    
    def setcursorposition(self, window_name, object_name, cursor_position):
        """

        if object_handle['AXEnabled']:
            raise LdtpServerException('Object %s state disabled' % object_name)
        object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange']['loc'] = cursor_position
        return 1

    window_name = 'sample_window'
    object_name = 'sample_object'
    cursor_position = 5
    
    chat_gpt = ChatGPT()
    result = chat_gpt.setcursorposition(window_name, object_name, cursor_position)
    print(f'Result: {result}')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```
            

## chatgpt: 

The statement involved in the bug is:

```
object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange']['loc'] = cursor_position
```

Since `AXSelectedTextRange` is a dictionary object, and dictionaries are mutable in Python, the method modifies the value of the `loc` key in that object to `cursor_position`. This modification **does not** return the expected result of setting the cursor position for the input `window_name` and `object_name`. This is because the `setcursorposition()` method returns without actually interacting with any input device or system, and therefore cannot set the actual cursor position as intended.

In addition, the `_get_object_handle()` method always returns the same dictionary object no matter what parameters it is passed, so this should also be investigated as it suggests potential incorrect behavior elsewhere in the code.
