Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            





















class LdtpServerException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, exception_message):
        super().__init__(exception_message)


class ChatGPT:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def _get_object_handle(self, window_name, object_name):
        
        
        return {'AXEnabled': True, 'AXSelectedTextRange': {'loc': 0}}
    
    def setcursorposition(self, window_name, object_name, cursor_position):
        """
                Set cursor position

                @param window_name: Window name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.
                @type window_name: string
                @param object_name: Object name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.
                @type object_name: string
                @param cursor_position: Cursor position to be set
                @type cursor_position: integer

                @return: 1 on success.
                @rtype: integer
                """
        object_handle = self._get_object_handle(window_name, object_name)
        if not ((not (object_handle['AXEnabled']))):
            raise LdtpServerException('Object %s state disabled' % object_name)
        object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange']['loc'] = cursor_position
        return 1


def main():
    window_name = 'sample_window'
    object_name = 'sample_object'
    cursor_position = 5
    
    chat_gpt = ChatGPT()
    result = chat_gpt.setcursorposition(window_name, object_name, cursor_position)
    print(f'Result: {result}')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```
            

## chatgpt: 

The code seems to be problem-free and there are no syntax errors. However, the method `_get_object_handle` is not implemented correctly. The method simply returns a fixed dictionary object with some static values, based on the input window name and object name, without actually doing anything meaningful. Therefore, the code will always execute without raising any exception, regardless of the values of the input arguments `window_name` and `object_name` passed to the function `setcursorposition`.

Additionally, `AXSelectedTextRange` might not be implemented for the object being used, which will raise another exception. As the commented code suggests, this issue is already known.

Lastly, the returned value of 1 in the function `setcursorposition` seems problematic, as it's not clear what it represents. It would be better to return a Boolean indicating success.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python

    def _get_object_handle(self, window_name, object_name):
        
        
        return {'AXEnabled': True, 'AXSelectedTextRange': {'loc': 0}}
    
    def setcursorposition(self, window_name, object_name, cursor_position):
        """
                Set cursor position

The `_get_object_handle` method does not actually do anything meaningful, and simply returns a fixed dictionary object with some static values, based on the input `window_name` and `object_name`, regardless of their values.

The line `object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange']['loc'] = cursor_position` may raise an exception if the object being operated on doesn't have the property `AXSelectedTextRange`.

The method `setcursorposition` returns the fixed integer value of `1` which is ambiguous as it doesn't indicate the nature of the success. It would be better to return a Boolean value to better indicate success or failure.
