Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            





















class LdtpServerException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, exception_message):
        super().__init__(exception_message)


class ChatGPT:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def _get_object_handle(self, window_name, object_name):
        
        
        return {'AXEnabled': True, 'AXSelectedTextRange': {'loc': 0}}
    
    def setcursorposition(self, window_name, object_name, cursor_position):
        """
                Set cursor position

                @param window_name: Window name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.
                @type window_name: string
                @param object_name: Object name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.
                @type object_name: string
                @param cursor_position: Cursor position to be set
                @type cursor_position: integer

                @return: 1 on success.
                @rtype: integer
                """
        object_handle = self._get_object_handle(window_name, object_name)
        if not (object_handle['AXEnabled']):
            raise LdtpServerException('Object %s state disabled' % object_name)
        object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange']['loc'] = cursor_position
        return 1


def main():
    window_name = 'sample_window'
    object_name = 'sample_object'
    cursor_position = 5
    
    chat_gpt = ChatGPT()
    result = chat_gpt.setcursorposition(window_name, object_name, cursor_position)
    print(f'Result: {result}')


if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()
            ```

The given code does not have any syntax errors, but it contains a logical error. Following are some issues in the code:

1. The '_get_object_handle' method returns a dictionary object with two keys 'AXEnabled' and 'AXSelectedTextRange' with fixed values, which does not depend on the provided arguments. This indicates that the said method would always return the same hardcoded dictionary object, irrespective of the arguments in the function call. Therefore, the obtained object may not be suitable to use as an object handle, as it does not represent the window and object provided in the function call.

2. The 'setcursorposition' method assigns a value to the 'loc' key of the 'AXSelectedTextRange' in the object_handle, which is unlikely to be the right approach to set the cursor position.

3. Although the code handles an exception, it raises an exception named 'LdtpServerException,' which indicates that the error originates from the LDTP (Linux Desktop Testing Project) server. However, the error message suggests that it is an application-side error. Therefore, this exception's name and message should match the origin of the error precisely.

Therefore, the code may not effectively set the cursor position as required. Furthermore, the LdtpServerException message is misleading, and hence needs correction.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python

        super().__init__(exception_message)

    def _get_object_handle(self, window_name, object_name):
        
        
        return {'AXEnabled': True, 'AXSelectedTextRange': {'loc': 0}}
    
    def setcursorposition(self, window_name, object_name, cursor_position):
        """
                Set cursor position

                @param window_name: Window name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.
                @type window_name: string
                @param object_name: Object name to type in, either full name,
                LDTP's name convention, or a Unix glob.

        object_handle = self._get_object_handle(window_name, object_name)
        if not (object_handle['AXEnabled']):
            raise LdtpServerException('Object %s state disabled' % object_name)
        object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange']['loc'] = cursor_position
        return 1


def main():
    window_name = 'sample_window'
    object_name = 'sample_object'
    cursor_position = 5
    
    chat_gpt = ChatGPT()
    result = chat_gpt.setcursorposition(window_name, object_name, cursor_position)
    print(f'Result: {result}')


if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()
            ```

The following statements in the 'setcursorposition' method have bugs:

1. `object_handle['AXSelectedTextRange']['loc'] = cursor_position`
  
    This code assigns the value of 'cursor_position' to the 'loc' attribute of the dictionary object returned by the '_get_object_handle' method. However, this is not the correct method to change the cursor position. Instead, we should use the appropriate method or API provided by the GUI library to change the cursor position.


2. `raise LdtpServerException('Object %s state disabled' % object_name)`

    The exception message generated by this code is misleading as it suggests that the exception is being raised because the object is in a disabled state. However, this is not the case, as the 'AXEnabled' attribute is being checked to see if the object can be used. Therefore, the exception message should convey the right reason for raising the exception. Also, if this exception is being raised, then the code should inform the user what action they can take to rectify this issue.
