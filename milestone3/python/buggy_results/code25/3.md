Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            




















import numpy as np
import h5py

class HDF5Manager:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self._file = h5py.File(filename, 'a')
        self._group = self._file.create_group('data')
        self._datasets = {}
    
    def create_empty_dataset(self, ds_name, dtype=np.float32):
        '''
        Creates a Dataset with unknown size.
        Resize it before using.

        :param ds_name: string

        :param dtype: dtype
        Datatype of the dataset

        :return: h5py DataSet
        '''
        if ds_name in self._datasets:
            return self._datasets[ds_name]
        
        ds = self._group.create_dataset(ds_name, (1, 1), maxshape=(None, None), dtype=dtype)
        self._datasets[ds_name] = ds
        
        return ds
    
    def close(self):
        self._file.close()


def main():
    hdf5_manager = HDF5Manager('test.h5')
    empty_dataset = hdf5_manager.create_empty_dataset('my_dataset', dtype=np.float64)
    print(empty_dataset)
    hdf5_manager.close()

if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()
            ```

The code seems to be correct with respect to syntax and functionality. The script creates an instance of a class called HDF5Manager and calls a method create_empty_dataset to create a new dataset if it doesn't exist already. The dataset created is given a name 'my_dataset' and the data type is chose as np.float64. MaxShape is defined as (None, None), it means that current dimensions can be expanded as the dataset grows. Finally, the newly created dataset is printed and the file is closed.

The script first checks if the imported module/program is the main program being executed, and if it is not, then it does not execute the main function. This is to prevent accidentally executing the main function if this script is being used as an imported module somewhere else.

Therefore, the code is not buggy.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            




















import numpy as np
import h5py

class HDF5Manager:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self._file = h5py.File(filename, 'a')
        self._group = self._file.create_group('data')
        self._datasets = {}
    
    def create_empty_dataset(self, ds_name, dtype=np.float32):
        '''
        Creates a Dataset with unknown size.
        Resize it before using.

        :param ds_name: string

        :param dtype: dtype
        Datatype of the dataset

        :return: h5py DataSet
        '''
        if ds_name in self._datasets:
            return self._datasets[ds_name]
        
        ds = self._group.create_dataset(ds_name, (1, 1), maxshape=(None, None), dtype=dtype)
        self._datasets[ds_name] = ds
        
        return ds
    
    def close(self):
        self._file.close()


def main():
    hdf5_manager = HDF5Manager('test.h5')
    empty_dataset = hdf5_manager.create_empty_dataset('my_dataset', dtype=np.float64)
    print(empty_dataset)
    hdf5_manager.close()

if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()
            ```

The code is not buggy. It can be run without errors and is expected to function as intended without any issues.
