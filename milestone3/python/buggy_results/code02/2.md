Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            import json
import tornado.web
import tornado.escape
import tornado.ioloop

class Access:
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_physical_plan(cluster, environ, topology):return {\
            'stmgrs': {\
            'stmgrId1': {\
            'host': 'localhost'}}, \
            \
            \
            'instances': {\
            'instance1': {\
            'stmgrId': 'stmgrId1'}}}
    
    
    
    
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_instance_pid(cluster, environ, topology, instance):return json.dumps({\
            'command': 'echo "Hello, World!"', \
            'stdout': 'Hello, World!'})



class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def get(self, cluster, environ, topology, instance):
        access = Access()
        pplan = access.get_physical_plan(cluster, environ, topology)
        host = pplan['stmgrs'][pplan['instances'][instance]['stmgrId']]['host']
        result = json.loads(access.get_instance_pid(
            cluster, environ, topology, instance))
        self.write('$%s>: %s%s' % (\
            host, \
            tornado.escape.xhtml_escape(result['command']), \
            tornado.escape.xhtml_escape(result['stdout'])))


def make_app():
    return tornado.web.Application([\
        ('/get/(\\w+)/(\\w+)/(\\w+)/(\\w+)', MainHandler)])



if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    app = make_app()
    app.listen(8888)
    tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current().start()
            ```

The code doesn't seem to have any obvious syntax errors or logical inconsistencies. However, it's difficult to know for sure without knowing what the code is intended to do. Depending on the expected behavior of the code, there may be some bugs or improvements that could be made.

Some general observations:

- The `Access` class has two static methods, which are called by the `MainHandler` class.
- The `get_physical_plan()` method returns a hardcoded dictionary with information about a Storm cluster.
- The `get_instance_pid()` method returns a JSON string with information about a command to be executed on a particular instance in the cluster.
- The `MainHandler` class defines a `get()` method that retrieves the physical plan for the cluster and the command to execute for a specific instance, and then prints the result to the client.

Some potential issues:

- The physical plan dictionary returned by `get_physical_plan()` is hardcoded, so it may not match the actual layout of the cluster.
- The `get_instance_pid()` method returns a JSON string, but the `MainHandler` class assumes that it's a dictionary and tries to access the `'command'` and `'stdout'` keys. If the JSON string is malformed, this could cause problems.
- The `get()` method assumes that the `instance` parameter is a key in the `instances` dictionary returned by `get_physical_plan()`. If it's not, this could cause a KeyError.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            import json
import tornado.web
import tornado.escape
import tornado.ioloop

class Access:
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_physical_plan(cluster, environ, topology):return {\
            'stmgrs': {\
            'stmgrId1': {\
            'host': 'localhost'}}, \
            \
            \
            'instances': {\
            'instance1': {\
            'stmgrId': 'stmgrId1'}}}
    
    
    
    
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_instance_pid(cluster, environ, topology, instance):return json.dumps({\
            'command': 'echo "Hello, World!"', \
            'stdout': 'Hello, World!'})



class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def get(self, cluster, environ, topology, instance):
        access = Access()
        pplan = access.get_physical_plan(cluster, environ, topology)
        host = pplan['stmgrs'][pplan['instances'][instance]['stmgrId']]['host']
        result = json.loads(access.get_instance_pid(
            cluster, environ, topology, instance))
        self.write('$%s>: %s%s' % (\
            host, \
            tornado.escape.xhtml_escape(result['command']), \
            tornado.escape.xhtml_escape(result['stdout'])))


def make_app():
    return tornado.web.Application([\
        ('/get/(\\w+)/(\\w+)/(\\w+)/(\\w+)', MainHandler)])



if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    app = make_app()
    app.listen(8888)
    tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current().start()
            ```

The code does not have a significant functional issue, but it violates the PEP8 standard in a few ways, such as:
- The indentation after the return keyword is inconsistent across functions.
- There are unnecessary backslashes at the end of lines.
- The parentheses around if statements are not necessary and the conditions can be simplified.

Regarding the functionality of the `MainHandler` class, it can be improved with the following suggestions:
- The `get()` method should include error handling for KeyError exceptions that can arise from accessing the physical plan and instance PID dictionary.
- The `get()` method should also handle JSON decode exceptions that can arise from decoding a malformed JSON response.
