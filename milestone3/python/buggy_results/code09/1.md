Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            













class Organization:
    def __init__(self, id, name, short_name, description, logo):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.short_name = short_name
        self.description = description
        self.logo = logo
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f'Organization(id={self.id}, name={self.name}, short_name={self.short_name}, description={self.description}, logo={self.logo})'





def deserialize_organization(organization_dict):
    '''
    Organization dict-to-object serialization
    '''
    return Organization(
        id=organization_dict.get('id'), 
        name=organization_dict.get('name', ''), 
        short_name=organization_dict.get('short_name', ''), 
        description=organization_dict.get('description', ''), 
        logo=organization_dict.get('logo', ''))



def main():
    organization_dict = {\
        'id': 1, \
        'name': 'Global Foundation', \
        'short_name': 'GF', \
        'description': 'An international nonprofit organization', \
        'logo': 'global_foundation_logo.png'}
    
    
    organization = deserialize_organization(organization_dict)
    print(organization)


if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()
            ```

The code seems to be correct. It is creating an Organization class object containing its attributes such as id, name, etc. The `deserialize_organization` function is used to deserialize (convert) a dictionary object, `organization_dict`, into an Organization class object by passing its id, name, short_name, description, and logo as properties of the Organization class.

The main function creates a dictionary `organization_dict`, passes it to `deserialize_organization`, initializes it to an organization object and prints the object's details.

The last line of the code (`if not (__name__ == '__main__':)`) is incorrect as it lacks a closing parentheses. Once it is corrected, the code will run without any issues.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            













class Organization:
    def __init__(self, id, name, short_name, description, logo):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.short_name = short_name
        self.description = description
        self.logo = logo
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f'Organization(id={self.id}, name={self.name}, short_name={self.short_name}, description={self.description}, logo={self.logo})'





def deserialize_organization(organization_dict):
    '''
    Organization dict-to-object serialization
    '''
    return Organization(
        id=organization_dict.get('id'), 
        name=organization_dict.get('name', ''), 
        short_name=organization_dict.get('short_name', ''), 
        description=organization_dict.get('description', ''), 
        logo=organization_dict.get('logo', ''))



def main():
    organization_dict = {\
        'id': 1, \
        'name': 'Global Foundation', \
        'short_name': 'GF', \
        'description': 'An international nonprofit organization', \
        'logo': 'global_foundation_logo.png'}
    
    
    organization = deserialize_organization(organization_dict)
    print(organization)


if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()
            ```

The given code is not buggy. It is correct and will run without any issues.

However, the last line `if not (__name__ == '__main__'):` has a syntax error. It lacks a closing parentheses, which might cause an error during execution. This line is used to check if the current module is being run as a script or not. It should be indented within the `if __name__ == '__main__':` conditional block like this:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This condition checks if the current file is being executed as the main program, and if it is, it calls the main function.
