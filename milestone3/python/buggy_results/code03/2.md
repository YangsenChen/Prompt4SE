Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            




class Metric:
    def __init__(self, name, value, time_bucket_in_sec):
        self.name = name
        self.value = value
        self.time_bucket_in_sec = time_bucket_in_sec


class MetricCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {}
    
    def register_metric(self, name, metric, time_bucket_in_sec):
        self.metrics[name] = Metric(name, metric, time_bucket_in_sec)


class Context:
    def __init__(self):
        self.collector = MetricCollector()
    
    def get_metrics_collector(self):
        return self.collector
    
    def register_metric(self, name, metric, time_bucket_in_sec):
        '''Registers a new metric to this context'''
        collector = self.get_metrics_collector()
        collector.register_metric(name, metric, time_bucket_in_sec)


if __name__ != '__main__':
    context = Context()
    context.register_metric('test_metric', 100, 60)
            ```

The code is not buggy. 

The code defines three classes: ``Metric``, ``MetricCollector`` and ``Context``. Each class has an ``__init__`` method that initializes its attributes and an instance method, ``register_metric``, that allows us to register new metrics. 

In the ``__init__`` method of the ``MetricCollector`` class, it initializes an empty dictionary called ``metrics`` where metrics can be stored. The ``register_metric`` method allows us to register new metrics.

The ``Context`` class initializes an instance of the ``MetricCollector`` class and has a method, ``get_metrics_collector``, which returns the metrics collector instance. The ``register_metric`` method of the ``Context`` class allows us to register a new metric to the context.

Finally, the code checks if the script is not being run as standalone and registers a new metric called ``test_metric``, with a value of ``100`` and a bucket time of ``60`` seconds.

Overall, the code is correct, and it functions as expected.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            




class Metric:
    def __init__(self, name, value, time_bucket_in_sec):
        self.name = name
        self.value = value
        self.time_bucket_in_sec = time_bucket_in_sec


class MetricCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {}
    
    def register_metric(self, name, metric, time_bucket_in_sec):
        self.metrics[name] = Metric(name, metric, time_bucket_in_sec)


class Context:
    def __init__(self):
        self.collector = MetricCollector()
    
    def get_metrics_collector(self):
        return self.collector
    
    def register_metric(self, name, metric, time_bucket_in_sec):
        '''Registers a new metric to this context'''
        collector = self.get_metrics_collector()
        collector.register_metric(name, metric, time_bucket_in_sec)


if __name__ != '__main__':
    context = Context()
    context.register_metric('test_metric', 100, 60)
            ```

The code has no syntax error. 

However, there is a logical error. The if statement at the end of the code--``if __name__ != '__main__':``--checks if the code is imported into another module or run from the shell. If so, it creates a new instance of the Context class and registers a new metric called 'test_metric' with a value of 100 and a time bucket of 60 seconds.

The issue with the code is that if it is run as a standalone script (as opposed to being imported to another module or run from the shell), the metric will not be registered, as the code will not reach the if statement at the bottom of the code. To fix this issue, the code needs to be moved outside the if statement so that it gets executed regardless of how the code is run.
