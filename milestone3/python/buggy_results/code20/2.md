Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            























from appdirs import unicode


class AccessibleApps:
    def __init__(self):
        self._running_apps = []
    
    def _update_apps(self):
        
        pass
    
    def getapplist(self):
        '''
        Get all accessibility application names that are currently running

        @return: list of application names of string type on success.
        @rtype: list
        '''
        app_list = []
        
        self._update_apps()
        for gui in self._running_apps:
            name = gui.localizedName()
            
            
            
            try:
                name = unicode(name)
            except NameError:
                raise
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
            app_list.append(name)
        
        return list(set(app_list))


def main():
    accessible_apps = AccessibleApps()
    app_list = accessible_apps.getapplist()
    print('Accessible applications:', app_list)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

The code seems to be correct and does not have any syntax error. However, there is an import statement for `unicode` which seems to be unnecessary because `unicode` function is built-in in Python 2, but removed in Python 3.
Furthermore, the current code is using `python2` syntax which is not supported since OpenAI currently only supports `python3`.
Finally, the module `appdirs` is used, but not imported. Therefore, the code may raise a `NameError` if `appdirs` module is not installed or if it is not imported.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            























from appdirs import unicode


class AccessibleApps:
    def __init__(self):
        self._running_apps = []
    
    def _update_apps(self):
        
        pass
    
    def getapplist(self):
        '''
        Get all accessibility application names that are currently running

        @return: list of application names of string type on success.
        @rtype: list
        '''
        app_list = []
        
        self._update_apps()
        for gui in self._running_apps:
            name = gui.localizedName()
            
            
            
            try:
                name = unicode(name)
            except NameError:
                raise
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
            app_list.append(name)
        
        return list(set(app_list))


def main():
    accessible_apps = AccessibleApps()
    app_list = accessible_apps.getapplist()
    print('Accessible applications:', app_list)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```
