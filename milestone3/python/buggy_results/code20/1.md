Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            























from appdirs import unicode


class AccessibleApps:
    def __init__(self):
        self._running_apps = []
    
    def _update_apps(self):
        
        pass
    
    def getapplist(self):
        '''
        Get all accessibility application names that are currently running

        @return: list of application names of string type on success.
        @rtype: list
        '''
        app_list = []
        
        self._update_apps()
        for gui in self._running_apps:
            name = gui.localizedName()
            
            
            
            try:
                name = unicode(name)
            except NameError:
                name = str(name)
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
            app_list.append(name)
        
        return list(set(app_list))


def main():
    accessible_apps = AccessibleApps()
    app_list = accessible_apps.getapplist()
    print('Accessible applications:', app_list)


if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()
            ```

The code snippet seems to be composed of different parts of code. Most of the functions are not implemented, and the module `appdirs` is not used in the given code.

However, there are still some minor issues and refactoring improvements that can be made.

- The import of `unicode` from `appdirs` is redundant and unnecessary.
- The `_update_apps` method has no implementation and is not doing any update on the `_running_app` attribute.
- The try-except statements inside the `getapplist` method can be simplified to a single statement that converts the `name` variable to a string.
- The `_running_apps` attribute is not declared as private using a double underscore notation.

Here is an updated version of the code snippet:

```python
class AccessibleApps:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__running_apps = []

    def __update_apps(self):
        # logic to update _running_apps

    def get_app_list(self):
        """
        Get all accessibility application names that are currently running

        :return: list of application names of string type on success.
        :rtype: list
        """
        self.__update_apps()
        app_list = [str(gui.localizedName()) for gui in self.__running_apps]
        return list(set(app_list))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    accessible_apps = AccessibleApps()
    app_list = accessible_apps.get_app_list()
    print("Accessible applications:", app_list)
```

The code imports only the necessary modules, defines `_running_apps` as private by using double underscores, updates the `get_app_list` method by removing unnecessary try-except statements and using list comprehension.

Lastly, the code runs the `get_app_list` method only when it is executed directly as a script using `if __name__ == "__main__"`. The function `main()` was also refactored to avoid having an empty body for the if-statement.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            























from appdirs import unicode


class AccessibleApps:
    def __init__(self):
        self._running_apps = []
    
    def _update_apps(self):
        
        pass
    
    def getapplist(self):
        '''
        Get all accessibility application names that are currently running

        @return: list of application names of string type on success.
        @rtype: list
        '''
        app_list = []
        
        self._update_apps()
        for gui in self._running_apps:
            name = gui.localizedName()
            
            
            
            try:
                name = unicode(name)
            except NameError:
                name = str(name)
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
            app_list.append(name)
        
        return list(set(app_list))


def main():
    accessible_apps = AccessibleApps()
    app_list = accessible_apps.getapplist()
    print('Accessible applications:', app_list)


if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()
            ```

The code snippet itself is not causing any errors, at least not visibly. The `_update_apps` method is empty and should be implemented to update the `_running_apps` attribute. 

However, without the inclusion of any other modules or importing other libraries, it is challenging to determine if the code will work correctly.

Therefore, the code may still contain hidden bugs, especially if the implementation of the missing code makes assumptions about other parts of the system.
