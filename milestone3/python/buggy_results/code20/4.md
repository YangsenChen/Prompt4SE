Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            























from appdirs import unicode


class AccessibleApps:
    def __init__(self):
        self._running_apps = []
    
    def _update_apps(self):
        
        pass
    
    def getapplist(self):
        '''
        Get all accessibility application names that are currently running

        @return: list of application names of string type on success.
        @rtype: list
        '''
        app_list = []
        
        self._update_apps()
        for gui in self._running_apps:
            name = gui.localizedName()
            
            
            
            try:
                name = unicode(name)
            except NameError:
                pass
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
            app_list.append(name)
        
        return list(set(app_list))


def main():
    accessible_apps = AccessibleApps()
    app_list = accessible_apps.getapplist()
    print('Accessible applications:', app_list)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```
            

## chatgpt: 

The code seems to be fine. However, the following lines are unused and can be removed:
```
from appdirs import unicode
...
try:
    name = unicode(name)
except NameError:
    pass
except UnicodeEncodeError:
    pass
``` 
The `unicode` function is already imported through `appdirs` module. Therefore, the above try-except block can be removed as it will never raise any `NameError` or `UnicodeEncodeError`.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            























from appdirs import unicode


class AccessibleApps:
    def __init__(self):
        self._running_apps = []
    
    def _update_apps(self):
        
        pass
    
    def getapplist(self):
        '''
        Get all accessibility application names that are currently running

        @return: list of application names of string type on success.
        @rtype: list
        '''
        app_list = []
        
        self._update_apps()
        for gui in self._running_apps:
            name = gui.localizedName()
            
            
            
            try:
                name = unicode(name)
            except NameError:
                pass
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
            app_list.append(name)
        
        return list(set(app_list))


def main():
    accessible_apps = AccessibleApps()
    app_list = accessible_apps.getapplist()
    print('Accessible applications:', app_list)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```
