Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            























from appdirs import unicode


class AccessibleApps:
    def __init__(self):
        self._running_apps = []
    
    def _update_apps(self):
        
        pass
    
    def getapplist(self):
        '''
        Get all accessibility application names that are currently running

        @return: list of application names of string type on success.
        @rtype: list
        '''
        app_list = []
        
        self._update_apps()
        for gui in self._running_apps:
            name = gui.localizedName()
            
            
            
            try:
                name = unicode(name)
            except NameError:
                name = str(name)
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
            app_list.append(name)
        
        return list(set(app_list))


def main():
    accessible_apps = AccessibleApps()
    app_list = accessible_apps.getapplist()
    print('Accessible applications:', app_list)


if __name__ != '__main__':
    main()
            ```

It's difficult to determine if the code is buggy as there are a lot of details missing like module-specific code that is not provided here. However, based on the information given, the code looks fine, and there are no obvious bugs. There are no syntax errors, syntax violations, or run-time errors that can be immediately spotted. 

Before calling the `unicode` function, the program is checking whether the `UnicodeEncodeError` exception has occurred, which is a good practice to avoid the program's abnormal termination. 

Moreover, the function seems to work as intended. It returns a list of accessibility applications. 

However, there are redundancies that could be improved, such as `list(set(app_list))`. We can remove `list` since the `set` method already converts the list to a set and returns it.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            























from appdirs import unicode


class AccessibleApps:
    def __init__(self):
        self._running_apps = []
    
    def _update_apps(self):
        
        pass
    
    def getapplist(self):
        '''
        Get all accessibility application names that are currently running

        @return: list of application names of string type on success.
        @rtype: list
        '''
        app_list = []
        
        self._update_apps()
        for gui in self._running_apps:
            name = gui.localizedName()
            
            
            
            try:
                name = unicode(name)
            except NameError:
                name = str(name)
            except UnicodeEncodeError:
                pass
            app_list.append(name)
        
        return list(set(app_list))


def main():
    accessible_apps = AccessibleApps()
    app_list = accessible_apps.getapplist()
    print('Accessible applications:', app_list)


if __name__ != '__main__':
    main()
            ```

The code seems to be logically correct. However, there is only one bug that can cause an error when running the program, and that is the import statement at the beginning of the code.

`from appdirs import unicode` - This line of code is not necessary in this specific program. The `unicode()` method is a built-in function in Python 2.x, but it is not supported in Python 3.x. Therefore, if the code is running on Python 3.x, importing `unicode` from `appdirs` will cause a `ModuleNotFoundError` as Python 3.x doesn't have a module named `unicode`.

A more Pythonic approach would be to use `str()` instead of `unicode()`. So the line should be changed to `name = str(name)` to avoid the exception.
