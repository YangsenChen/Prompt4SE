Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return (not (self.isBool(type)) or \
        not (self.isString(type)) or \
        not (self.isNum(type)))
            ```

Based on the function signature and the name of the function `isBin()`, it appears that the function checks whether the input `type` is a binary value or not. However, looking at the code implementation, it seems to be checking whether the input `type` is not a boolean value, a string value, and a numeric value. If any of these conditions is true, then it returns `True` i.e., it considers the input `type` as binary.

Therefore, the code has a logical bug, and the return statement should be modified to return `False` if any of the conditions is true. The corrected code is shown below:

```python
def isBin(self, type):
    '''
    is the type a byte array value?

    :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
    :rtype: bool
    '''
    return (not (self.isBool(type)) and \
        not (self.isString(type)) and \
        not (self.isNum(type)))
```

In this corrected code, the return statement returns `True` only if all the conditions are false i.e., the input `type` is not a boolean, not a string, and not a numeric value. So, if any of these conditions is true, then it returns `False` i.e., the input `type` is not a binary value.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return (not (self.isBool(type)) or \
        not (self.isString(type)) or \
        not (self.isNum(type)))
            ```

The given code has a logical bug in the return statement. 

The intention of the function `isBin` is to return `True` if the input `type` is a byte array value and `False` otherwise. However, the current implementation returns `True` if any of the three conditions in the return statement are true: 

1. `not (self.isBool(type))`
2. `not (self.isString(type))`
3. `not (self.isNum(type))`

This means that even if any one of the three conditions is true, the function will return `True`, which could lead to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, the logical operator between the three conditions should be `and` instead of `or`, so that the function only returns `True` if all three conditions are true. The corrected code is shown below:

```python
def isBin(self, type):
    '''
    is the type a byte array value?

    :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
    :rtype: bool
    '''
    return (self.isBool(type) and self.isString(type) and self.isNum(type))
```

In this corrected code, the return statement returns `True` only if all three conditions are true, i.e., the input `type` is a byte array value. If any one of the conditions is false, then the function returns `False`.
