Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return (self.isBool(type) and \
        not (self.isString(type)) and \
        not (self.isNum(type)))
            ```

It is difficult to accurately determine the purpose of this code without having access to the entire codebase and relevant documentation. Moreover, it is not clear what `self` refers to and what other methods it has.

Based on the code snippet provided, it seems like the function `isBin` is attempting to determine if a variable of a given PKCS#11 type is a byte array. It does this by checking if the type is not a string or a number, but is instead a boolean.

There doesn't seem to be any syntax errors or obvious logic errors in the code snippet. However, there are some problems:

1. The method `isNum()` doesn't seem to be defined, so it will throw an error.
2. `type` is reserved in Python, so it's not recommended to have a variable or parameter name named "type". 
3. It's not clear what `isBool()` and `isString()` do, so it's possible that the function could return incorrect data if those methods are not implemented correctly.
4. The function could benefit from better documentation and variable naming to improve readability and understandability.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return (self.isBool(type) and \
        not (self.isString(type)) and \
        not (self.isNum(type)))
            ```

The code logic seems to be correct. However, there are some potential issues in the code:

1. The method `isNum()` is referenced, but does not appear to be defined in the given code snippet. So, this code will throw an error.
2. It is not clear what `self.isBool()` and `self.isString()` actually do. If these functions are themselves buggy, then this code may not function correctly.
3. `type` is a built-in function in Python. It is generally not a good practice to use built-in function names as variable or parameter names.

Apart from that, there seem to be no syntax errors or any obvious logic errors in the code, based on the provided code snippet.
