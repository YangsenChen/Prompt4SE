Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return (not (self.isBool(type)) and \
        not (self.isString(type)) and \
        self.isNum(type))
            ```

The code appears to be checking whether the input type is a byte array or not. It checks if the type is not a boolean type, not a string type and is a numeric type. However, there are a few issues with the code:

1. The function definition is missing the `self` parameter which suggests that it could be a member function of a class. If this function is part of a class, the class name should be included, and `self` should be used as the first parameter rather than `type`.

2. The `isNum` function is not defined in the code snippet, so it is unclear what it does or returns.

3. `type` is a built-in Python function, so using it as a parameter name could cause unexpected behavior.

Assuming that `self.isNum(type)` is correctly implemented, the code should work as expected, but the issues mentioned above could lead to errors.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return (not (self.isBool(type)) and \
        not (self.isString(type)) and \
        self.isNum(type))
            ```

Based on the given code snippet, it can be said that the `isBin` function is buggy because:

1. The definition of the function should have a `self` parameter as the first parameter as it appears to be a method of a class, but it is missing which could lead to errors if it is called as a method.

2. The parameter name used in the function definition is `type` which is a built-in Python function. Using this as a parameter name may cause unexpected behavior.

3. The `isNum` function used inside the `isBin` function is not defined in the given code snippet. If it is not defined correctly, it could result in an error.

4. It is unclear from the code what the definition of `self.isBool` and `self.isString` is. If these functions are not defined or defined incorrectly, the overall function will not work correctly.

Therefore, it is not possible to identify the specific statement(s) involved in the bug without additional information about the implementation of `self.isNum`, `self.isBool`, and `self.isString` functions.
