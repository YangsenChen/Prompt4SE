Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return (not (self.isBool(type)) and \
        self.isString(type) and \
        not (self.isNum(type)))
            ```

Based on the given code, it is difficult to determine the variable data type that is passed to the function isBin(). The function takes a parameter called `type` and returns a boolean value based on the conditions mentioned within the function.

However, the function is dependent on the implementation of three functions: `self.isBool()`, `self.isString()`, and `self.isNum()`, that are not defined in the code snippet.

Therefore, the given code is incomplete for analysis, and without the complete implementation of the code and dependent functions, it is impossible to determine whether the code contains any bugs or errors.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            def isBin(self, type):
    '''
        is the type a byte array value?

        :param type: PKCS#11 type like `CKA_MODULUS`
        :rtype: bool
        '''
    return (not (self.isBool(type)) and \
        self.isString(type) and \
        not (self.isNum(type)))
            ```

Without knowledge of the implementation of the `self.isBool()`, `self.isString()`, and `self.isNum()` functions, it is difficult to determine if these functions contain any bugs that could cause the `isBin()` function to be erroneous. However, based solely on the code presented, it is possible to identify a few issues:

1. The parameter named `type` has the same name as a built-in data type in Python, which could cause naming conflicts that could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

2. The function does not validate the inputs and does not provide any appropriate error or exception handling logic. If any of the dependent functions (`self.isBool()`, `self.isString()`, and `self.isNum()`) receive incorrect inputs or parameters, these functions might produce unexpected outputs and thus result in incorrect results by the `isBin()` function.

3. The boolean expression `not (self.isBool(type)) and self.isString(type) and not (self.isNum(type)))` in the `return` statement of the function is too complex. It may be difficult to reason about and may contain bugs that are hard to detect.

Therefore, while it is difficult to identify the specific statements that are involved in the reported bug, there are several elements of the `isBin()` function that could be improved to make the function more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone.
