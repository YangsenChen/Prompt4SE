Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            
























import numpy


class Validator:
    def _is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(self, value):
        '''Determines whether value is a tuple of the format
        (compound(str), mfr(float), temperature(float)).

        :param value: The value to be tested.

        :returns: True or False'''
        
        if not (type(value) is tuple):
            return False
        elif not (len(value) == 3):
            return False
        elif not (type(value[0]) is str):
            return False
        elif (not (type(value[1]) is float) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float64) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        elif (not (type(value[2]) is float) and \
            type(value[2]) is numpy.float64 and \
            not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        else:
            return True


def main():
    validator = Validator()
    test_value = ('compound', 1.2, 3.0)
    result = validator._is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(test_value)
    print('Is test_value valid? :', result)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```
            

## chatgpt: 

The code seems to work fine, but there's a typo in the third elif condition that may cause a bug in some cases. Specifically, there's a missing "not" that should negate the second half of the condition.

So, the corrected line should be:
```
elif (not (type(value[2]) is float) and \
      not(type(value[2]) is numpy.float64) and \
      not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float32)):
```

This ensures that if the type of value[2] is not float or numpy.float64 or numpy.float32, it returns False.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            
























import numpy


class Validator:
    def _is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(self, value):
        '''Determines whether value is a tuple of the format
        (compound(str), mfr(float), temperature(float)).

        :param value: The value to be tested.

        :returns: True or False'''
        
        if not (type(value) is tuple):
            return False
        elif not (len(value) == 3):
            return False
        elif not (type(value[0]) is str):
            return False
        elif (not (type(value[1]) is float) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float64) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        elif (not (type(value[2]) is float) and \
            type(value[2]) is numpy.float64 and \
            not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        else:
            return True


def main():
    validator = Validator()
    test_value = ('compound', 1.2, 3.0)
    result = validator._is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(test_value)
    print('Is test_value valid? :', result)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, there's a typo in the code that could cause a bug in some cases. In the fifth elif statement, the condition that checks for the type of value[2] is not correct. 

Specifically, the condition should be:
```
elif (not (type(value[2]) is float) and \
      not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float64) and \
      not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float32)):
```
There is a missing "not" in front of the second half of the condition, which can result in the wrong return value.
