Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            
























import numpy


class Validator:
    def _is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(self, value):
        '''Determines whether value is a tuple of the format
        (compound(str), mfr(float), temperature(float)).

        :param value: The value to be tested.

        :returns: True or False'''
        
        if not (type(value) is tuple):
            return False
        elif not (len(value) == 3):
            return False
        elif not (type(value[0]) is str):
            return False
        elif (not (type(value[1]) is float) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float64) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        elif (type(value[2]) is float and \
            not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float64) and \
            not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        else:
            return True


def main():
    validator = Validator()
    test_value = ('compound', 1.2, 3.0)
    result = validator._is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(test_value)
    print('Is test_value valid? :', result)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

The code looks correct and does not have any syntax errors. The function `_is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple()` takes a tuple as input and verifies if it is of the correct format according to the provided conditions. The main program calls this function to test its functionality. The code does not contain any arithmetic operations, so there are no arithmetic bugs. However, there is the possibility that the code has other issues, such as logical errors or incorrect syntax usage.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            
























import numpy


class Validator:
    def _is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(self, value):
        '''Determines whether value is a tuple of the format
        (compound(str), mfr(float), temperature(float)).

        :param value: The value to be tested.

        :returns: True or False'''
        
        if not (type(value) is tuple):
            return False
        elif not (len(value) == 3):
            return False
        elif not (type(value[0]) is str):
            return False
        elif (not (type(value[1]) is float) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float64) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        elif (type(value[2]) is float and \
            not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float64) and \
            not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        else:
            return True


def main():
    validator = Validator()
    test_value = ('compound', 1.2, 3.0)
    result = validator._is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(test_value)
    print('Is test_value valid? :', result)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

The code seems to be correct and does not have any logical errors. As for syntax errors, there aren't any to be found either. Thus, I can not spot any statements involved in the bug in the code.
