Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            
























import numpy


class Validator:
    def _is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(self, value):
        '''Determines whether value is a tuple of the format
        (compound(str), mfr(float), temperature(float)).

        :param value: The value to be tested.

        :returns: True or False'''
        
        if not (type(value) is tuple):
            return False
        elif not (len(value) == 3):
            return False
        elif not (type(value[0]) is str):
            return False
        elif (not (type(value[1]) is float) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float64) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        elif (not (type(value[2]) is float) or \
            not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float64) or \
            not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        else:
            return True


def main():
    validator = Validator()
    test_value = ('compound', 1.2, 3.0)
    result = validator._is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(test_value)
    print('Is test_value valid? :', result)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, the code has a bug. The `or` operator is used by mistake in the conditional statement where `type(value[2])` is being checked for the types `float`, `numpy.float64`, and `numpy.float32`). The intended check is supposed to be on all three conditions being true, but because of the use of the `or` operator, the check will pass if any one of the three conditions is true, whereas all three conditions should be true.

So the line:
```
elif (not (type(value[2]) is float) or \
      not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float64) or \
      not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float32)):
```
should be replaced with the following corrected line:
```
elif not (type(value[2]) is float or type(value[2]) is numpy.float64 or type(value[2]) is numpy.float32):
```

Also, a minor comment regarding the formatting of the code: there are too many blank lines at the beginning and end of the code. It is better to keep the code organized without too many unnecessary blank lines.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            
























import numpy


class Validator:
    def _is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(self, value):
        '''Determines whether value is a tuple of the format
        (compound(str), mfr(float), temperature(float)).

        :param value: The value to be tested.

        :returns: True or False'''
        
        if not (type(value) is tuple):
            return False
        elif not (len(value) == 3):
            return False
        elif not (type(value[0]) is str):
            return False
        elif (not (type(value[1]) is float) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float64) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        elif (not (type(value[2]) is float) or \
            not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float64) or \
            not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        else:
            return True


def main():
    validator = Validator()
    test_value = ('compound', 1.2, 3.0)
    result = validator._is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(test_value)
    print('Is test_value valid? :', result)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, there is a bug in the code, and the error is in the following code statement:

```
elif (not (type(value[2]) is float) or \
    not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float64) or \
    not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float32)):
```

The problem here is the use of logical OR (`or`) between the three conditions instead of logical AND (`and`). Therefore, as soon as the type of `value[2]` matches any of the three given types, the condition will evaluate to True, which is not the intended behavior. The statement should be updated as follows:

```
elif not (type(value[2]) is float or type(value[2]) is numpy.float64 or type(value[2]) is numpy.float32):
```

This way, the condition will be True only if the type of `value[2]` matches all of the three given types.
