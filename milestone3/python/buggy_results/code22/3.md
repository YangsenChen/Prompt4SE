Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            
























import numpy


class Validator:
    def _is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(self, value):
        '''Determines whether value is a tuple of the format
        (compound(str), mfr(float), temperature(float)).

        :param value: The value to be tested.

        :returns: True or False'''
        
        if not (type(value) is tuple):
            return False
        elif not ((not (len(value) == 3))):
            return False
        elif not (type(value[0]) is str):
            return False
        elif (not (type(value[1]) is float) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float64) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        elif (not (type(value[2]) is float) and \
            not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float64) and \
            not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        else:
            return True


def main():
    validator = Validator()
    test_value = ('compound', 1.2, 3.0)
    result = validator._is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(test_value)
    print('Is test_value valid? :', result)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, the code contains a bug. Specifically, the following line is the culprit:
```
elif not ((not (len(value) == 3))):
```
It should be modified to read:
```
elif not (len(value) == 3):
```
In the original version, the `not` before the condition is redundant and causes the conditional to always evaluate to `False`. Hence, the code will always skip this check, leading to tuples with incorrect numbers of elements passing the validation test.

Other than that, the code seems to be functioning correctly. It defines a class `Validator` with a method `_is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple` that checks whether a given value is of the form `(compound(str), mfr(float), temperature(float))`, where `compound` is a string and `mfr` and `temperature` are floating-point values. The function checks the length and type of the elements of the tuple and returns `True` if they match the expected format, and `False` otherwise. In the main function, an instance of `Validator` is created and the `_is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple` method is called with a test tuple to check if it works as expected. Finally, the result of the validation is printed to the console.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            
























import numpy


class Validator:
    def _is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(self, value):
        '''Determines whether value is a tuple of the format
        (compound(str), mfr(float), temperature(float)).

        :param value: The value to be tested.

        :returns: True or False'''
        
        if not (type(value) is tuple):
            return False
        elif not ((not (len(value) == 3))):
            return False
        elif not (type(value[0]) is str):
            return False
        elif (not (type(value[1]) is float) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float64) and \
            not (type(value[1]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        elif (not (type(value[2]) is float) and \
            not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float64) and \
            not (type(value[2]) is numpy.float32)):
            return False
        else:
            return True


def main():
    validator = Validator()
    test_value = ('compound', 1.2, 3.0)
    result = validator._is_compound_mfr_temperature_tuple(test_value)
    print('Is test_value valid? :', result)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, the code contains a bug. The following lines are the ones causing the bug:
```
elif not ((not (len(value) == 3))):
```
This line should be modified to read:
```
elif not (len(value) == 3):
```
The double negation of the length comparison causes the condition to always return `False`, which leads to tuples with the wrong number of elements passing the validation check.

This bug can be fixed by removing the extra negation, so the check becomes `if not (len(value) == 3):` instead.
