Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            










from threading import Lock
import time
from watchdog.observers import Observer

class DirectoryMonitor:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._observer = Observer()
        self._running = False
        self._status_lock = Lock()
        self._origin_mapped_data = dict()
    
    def stop(self):
        '''
        Stops monitoring the predefined directory.
        '''
        with self._status_lock:
            if self._running:
                assert self._observer is not None
                self._observer.stop()
                self._running = False
                self._origin_mapped_data = dict()
    
    def start(self):
        '''
        Starts monitoring the predefined directory.
        '''
        with self._status_lock:
            if not (self._running):
                self._observer.start()
                self._running = True
    
    def setup_observer(self, directory, event_handler):
        '''
        Sets up the observer to monitor the directory with the given event handler.
        '''
        self._observer.schedule(event_handler, directory, recursive=True)

def main():
    import sys
    from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
    
    if len(sys.argv) > 2:
        print('Usage: python script.py [directory_to_monitor]')
        return
    
    directory_to_monitor = sys.argv[1]
    
    monitor = DirectoryMonitor()
    event_handler = FileSystemEventHandler()
    monitor.setup_observer(directory_to_monitor, event_handler)
    monitor.start()
    
    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        monitor.stop()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

The code appears to be correct, but there may be some issues. The code deals with directory monitoring using the watchdog library and the threading module. The code defines a class `DirectoryMonitor` with `__init__`, `stop`, `start`, and `setup_observer` methods. Also, the `main` function calls the `DirectoryMonitor` methods to start monitoring the directory. 

However, there are some issues in the code:

- In the `main` function, there is no check if the argument `directory_to_monitor` is passed or not before setting `directory_to_monitor = sys.argv[1]`. It could throw an `IndexError` if `sys.argv[1]` does not exist.

- In the `stop` function of the `DirectoryMonitor` class, there is an assertion check for the `_observer` attribute, which could potentially throw an `AttributeError` if the `_observer` attribute is not defined.

- The `finally` block in the `main` function should release any resources that are being used by the observer or event_handler.

- The event_handler is defined but not implemented. It could be implemented by defining functions for each file system event such as on_modified, on_deleted, on_created, etc.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            










from threading import Lock
import time
from watchdog.observers import Observer

class DirectoryMonitor:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._observer = Observer()
        self._running = False
        self._status_lock = Lock()
        self._origin_mapped_data = dict()
    
    def stop(self):
        '''
        Stops monitoring the predefined directory.
        '''
        with self._status_lock:
            if self._running:
                assert self._observer is not None
                self._observer.stop()
                self._running = False
                self._origin_mapped_data = dict()

                self._running = True
    
    def setup_observer(self, directory, event_handler):
        '''
        Sets up the observer to monitor the directory with the given event handler.
        '''
        self._observer.schedule(event_handler, directory, recursive=True)

        print('Usage: python script.py [directory_to_monitor]')
        return
    
    directory_to_monitor = sys.argv[1]
    
    monitor = DirectoryMonitor()
    event_handler = FileSystemEventHandler()
    monitor.setup_observer(directory_to_monitor, event_handler)
    monitor.start()
    
    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        monitor.stop()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

The code isn't buggy as far as I can see, but there are some potential issues:

- In the `main` function, there is no check if the argument `directory_to_monitor` is passed or not before setting `directory_to_monitor = sys.argv[1]`. It could throw an `IndexError` if `sys.argv[1]` does not exist.

- In the `stop` function of the `DirectoryMonitor` class, there is an assertion check for the `_observer` attribute, which could potentially throw an `AttributeError` if the `_observer` attribute is not defined.

- The `finally` block in the `main` function should release any resources that are being used by the observer or event_handler.

- The `event_handler` is defined but not implemented. It could be implemented by defining functions for each file system event such as on_modified, on_deleted, on_created, etc.
