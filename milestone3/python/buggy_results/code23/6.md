Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            










from threading import Lock
import time
from watchdog.observers import Observer

class DirectoryMonitor:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._observer = Observer()
        self._running = False
        self._status_lock = Lock()
        self._origin_mapped_data = dict()
    
    def stop(self):
        '''
        Stops monitoring the predefined directory.
        '''
        with self._status_lock:
            if self._running:
                assert self._observer is not None
                self._observer.stop()
                self._running = False
                self._origin_mapped_data = dict()
    
    def start(self):
        '''
        Starts monitoring the predefined directory.
        '''
        with self._status_lock:
            if not (self._running):
                self._observer.start()
                self._running = True
    
    def setup_observer(self, directory, event_handler):
        '''
        Sets up the observer to monitor the directory with the given event handler.
        '''
        self._observer.schedule(event_handler, directory, recursive=True)

def main():
    import sys
    from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
    
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print('Usage: python script.py [directory_to_monitor]')
        return
    
    directory_to_monitor = sys.argv[1]
    
    monitor = DirectoryMonitor()
    event_handler = FileSystemEventHandler()
    monitor.setup_observer(directory_to_monitor, event_handler)
    monitor.start()
    
    try:
        while not True:
            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        monitor.stop()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, the code has a bug. The condition of the `while` loop in the `main` function is always `False`, which means that the loop will never run, and the code will hang indefinitely. The correct condition would be to check for `True` or some other condition that causes the loop to exit.

Also, the `time.sleep(1)` call in the loop will cause the loop to sleep for 1 second on each iteration, regardless of any events that may be received by the observer. A better approach would be to use a blocking call to `Observer.start()` with a timeout parameter of 1 second, which will cause the loop to block until an event is received or until the timeout expires.

Finally, the `stop()` method of the `DirectoryMonitor` class assumes that the `_observer` attribute is not `None`, but this is not guaranteed to be true if `setup_observer()` has not been called yet. It would be better to check if `_observer` is not `None` before trying to call any methods on it.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            










from threading import Lock

class DirectoryMonitor:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._observer = Observer()
        self._running = False
        self._status_lock = Lock()
        self._origin_mapped_data = dict()
    
    def stop(self):
        '''
        Stops monitoring the predefined directory.
        '''
        with self._status_lock:
            if self._running:
                assert self._observer is not None
                self._observer.stop()
                self._running = False
                self._origin_mapped_data = dict()
    
    def start(self):
        '''

        with self._status_lock:
            if not (self._running):
                self._observer.start()
                self._running = True
    
    def setup_observer(self, directory, event_handler):

    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print('Usage: python script.py [directory_to_monitor]')
        return
    
    directory_to_monitor = sys.argv[1]
    
    monitor = DirectoryMonitor()
    event_handler = FileSystemEventHandler()
    monitor.setup_observer(directory_to_monitor, event_handler)
    monitor.start()
    
    try:
        while not True:
            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        monitor.stop()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

The condition of the while loop in the `main` function is always `False`, which means that the loop will never run and the program will hang indefinitely. The correct condition would be to check for `True` or some other condition that causes the loop to exit.

Also, it seems like the intention of the loop is to keep the program running indefinitely until interrupted by a keyboard interrupt signal (`KeyboardInterrupt`). However, the loop is not actually doing anything other than sleeping for 1 second on each iteration, which is not sufficient for monitoring file events and responding to them.

Finally, the `stop()` method of the `DirectoryMonitor` class assumes that the `_observer` attribute is not `None`, but this is not guaranteed to be true if `setup_observer()` has not been called yet. It would be better to check if `_observer` is not `None` before trying to call any methods on it.
