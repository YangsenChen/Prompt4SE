Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            




























import datetime

class MucPresence:
    def __init__(self, to_jid=None):
        self.to_jid = to_jid
    
    def make_join_request(self, password, history_maxchars, history_maxstanzas, \
        history_seconds, history_since):
        pass

class MucRoom:
    def __init__(self, room_jid, manager):
        self.room_jid = room_jid
        self.manager = manager
        self.joined = False
    
    def join(self, password=None, history_maxchars=None, \
        history_maxstanzas=None, history_seconds=None, history_since=None):
        '''
        Send a join request for the room.

        :Parameters:
            ...
        '''
        if self.joined:
            raise RuntimeError('Room is already joined')
        p = MucPresence(to_jid=self.room_jid)
        p.make_join_request(password, history_maxchars, history_maxstanzas, 
            history_seconds, history_since)
        self.manager.stream.send(p)

class Manager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stream = Stream()

class Stream:
    def send(self, p):
        pass

def main():
    manager = Manager()
    room_jid = 'example_room@example.com'
    muc_room = MucRoom(room_jid, manager)
    muc_room.join(password='example_password', history_maxchars=1000)

if __name__ != '__main__':
    main()
            ```

The code is valid syntactically and has no syntax errors. However, there are some logical errors that can be corrected.

1. The `make_join_request` method of the `MucPresence` class does not return anything. This method should generally return an IQ object.

2. The `join` method of the `MucRoom` class should set the `self.joined` flag to `True` after the join request has been sent.

3. The `if __name__ != '__main__'` statement should be changed to `if __name__ == '__main__'` in order for the `main()` function to be executed when the script is run.

4. The `history_maxchars` parameter in the `join` method of the `MucRoom` class is misspelled. It should be `history_maxchars`.

5. Lastly, the `manager.stream` attribute should be initialized with a `Stream` object or the `send` method of the `Stream` class should be implemented.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            




























import datetime

class MucPresence:
    def __init__(self, to_jid=None):
        self.to_jid = to_jid
    
    def make_join_request(self, password, history_maxchars, history_maxstanzas, \
        history_seconds, history_since):
        pass

class MucRoom:
    def __init__(self, room_jid, manager):
        self.room_jid = room_jid
        self.manager = manager
        self.joined = False
    
    def join(self, password=None, history_maxchars=None, \
        history_maxstanzas=None, history_seconds=None, history_since=None):
        '''
        Send a join request for the room.

        :Parameters:
            ...
        '''
        if self.joined:
            raise RuntimeError('Room is already joined')
        p = MucPresence(to_jid=self.room_jid)
        p.make_join_request(password, history_maxchars, history_maxstanzas, 
            history_seconds, history_since)
        self.manager.stream.send(p)

class Manager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stream = Stream()

class Stream:
    def send(self, p):
        pass

def main():
    manager = Manager()
    room_jid = 'example_room@example.com'
    muc_room = MucRoom(room_jid, manager)
    muc_room.join(password='example_password', history_maxchars=1000)

if __name__ != '__main__':
    main()
            ```
