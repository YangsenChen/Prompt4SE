Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            




























import datetime

class MucPresence:
    def __init__(self, to_jid=None):
        self.to_jid = to_jid
    
    def make_join_request(self, password, history_maxchars, history_maxstanzas, \
        history_seconds, history_since):
        pass

class MucRoom:
    def __init__(self, room_jid, manager):
        self.room_jid = room_jid
        self.manager = manager
        self.joined = False
    
    def join(self, password=None, history_maxchars=None, \
        history_maxstanzas=None, history_seconds=None, history_since=None):
        '''
        Send a join request for the room.

        :Parameters:
            ...
        '''
        if not (self.joined):
            raise RuntimeError('Room is already joined')
        p = MucPresence(to_jid=self.room_jid)
        p.make_join_request(password, history_maxchars, history_maxstanzas, 
            history_seconds, history_since)
        self.manager.stream.send(p)

class Manager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stream = Stream()

class Stream:
    def send(self, p):
        pass

def main():
    manager = Manager()
    room_jid = 'example_room@example.com'
    muc_room = MucRoom(room_jid, manager)
    muc_room.join(password='example_password', history_maxchars=1000)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, the code is buggy. There are at least two bugs:

1. The conditional check inside MucRoom.join() method is incorrect. 
2. The MucPresence.make_join_request() method is not implemented, which can cause a runtime error.

The first bug is that the condition check in MucRoom.join() method is incorrect. It should be checked for `True`, not `False`. So the correct code should be:
```python
        if self.joined:
            raise RuntimeError('Room is already joined')
```

The second bug is that the MucPresence.make_join_request() method is defined but not implemented. It should have some logic to make the join request for the room, but it only has a `pass` statement, which does nothing. This can cause a runtime error when the method is called later on.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            




























import datetime

class MucPresence:
    def __init__(self, to_jid=None):
        self.to_jid = to_jid
    
    def make_join_request(self, password, history_maxchars, history_maxstanzas, \
        history_seconds, history_since):
        pass

class MucRoom:
    def __init__(self, room_jid, manager):
        self.room_jid = room_jid
        self.manager = manager
        self.joined = False
    
    def join(self, password=None, history_maxchars=None, \
        history_maxstanzas=None, history_seconds=None, history_since=None):
        '''
        Send a join request for the room.

        :Parameters:
            ...
        '''
        if not (self.joined):
            raise RuntimeError('Room is already joined')
        p = MucPresence(to_jid=self.room_jid)
        p.make_join_request(password, history_maxchars, history_maxstanzas, 
            history_seconds, history_since)
        self.manager.stream.send(p)

class Manager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stream = Stream()

class Stream:
    def send(self, p):
        pass

def main():
    manager = Manager()
    room_jid = 'example_room@example.com'
    muc_room = MucRoom(room_jid, manager)
    muc_room.join(password='example_password', history_maxchars=1000)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, there are at least two statements involved in the bug:

1. The `if` statement in the `join()` method of the `MucRoom` class is incorrect, it should be checking for `True` not `False`. It should be changed from:
```
if not (self.joined):
```
to:
```
if self.joined:
```

2. The `make_join_request()` method of the `MucPresence` class is not implemented, it only has a `pass` statement. Therefore, calling this method in the `join()` method of the `MucRoom` class will result in a runtime error. This method needs to be implemented to correct the bug.

In summary, the two identified statements involved in the bug are the incorrect `if` statement in the `join()` method of the `MucRoom` class and the unimplemented `make_join_request()` method of the `MucPresence` class.
