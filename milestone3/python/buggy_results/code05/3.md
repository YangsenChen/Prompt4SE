Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            














import requests
import re

def playstyles(year=2019, timeout=5):
    '''Return all playstyles in dict {id0: playstyle0, id1: playstyle1}.

    :params year: Year.
    '''
    messages_url = 'http://yourwebsite.com'
    rc = requests.get(messages_url, timeout=timeout)
    rc.encoding = 'utf-8'
    rc = rc.text
    data = re.findall('"playstyles.%s.playstyle([0-9]+)": "(.+)"' % year, rc)
    playstyles = {}
    for i in data:
        playstyles[int(i[0])] = i[1]
    return playstyles

def main():
    year = 2023
    timeout = 5
    playstyles_dict = playstyles(year, timeout)
    print(playstyles_dict)

if __name__ != '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, there are some issues with the code which are as follows:

1. In the function `playstyles`, the URL `http://yourwebsite.com` needs to be replaced with the actual URL of the website to be scrapped. 
2. In the same function, the regular expression pattern in the `re.findall` call is looking for the year  `year` in the URL, however, the provided argument `year` is an integer representing the year of interest. So this line needs to be adjusted to include the year in the URL, e.g. `'"playstyles/{}.playstyle([0-9]+)": "(.+)"'.format(year)`.
3. `if __name__ != '__main__':` should be replaced with `if __name__ == '__main__':` to ensure that this code block is executed only when this module is run as the main program and not imported by another module.
4. There is also a typo, `arithmetic` is misspelled as `arithmatic`.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            














import requests
import re

def playstyles(year=2019, timeout=5):
    '''Return all playstyles in dict {id0: playstyle0, id1: playstyle1}.

    :params year: Year.
    '''
    messages_url = 'http://yourwebsite.com'
    rc = requests.get(messages_url, timeout=timeout)
    rc.encoding = 'utf-8'
    rc = rc.text
    data = re.findall('"playstyles.%s.playstyle([0-9]+)": "(.+)"' % year, rc)
    playstyles = {}
    for i in data:
        playstyles[int(i[0])] = i[1]
    return playstyles

def main():
    year = 2023
    timeout = 5
    playstyles_dict = playstyles(year, timeout)
    print(playstyles_dict)

if __name__ != '__main__':
    main()
            ```

The bug in this code is with the `messages_url` variable which is improperly set to `'http://yourwebsite.com'`. The variable should be set to the correct URL for the website that is being scraped.
