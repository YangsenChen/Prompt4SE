Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            














import requests
import re

def playstyles(year=2019, timeout=5):
    '''Return all playstyles in dict {id0: playstyle0, id1: playstyle1}.

    :params year: Year.
    '''
    messages_url = 'http://yourwebsite.com'
    rc = requests.get(messages_url, timeout=timeout)
    rc.encoding = 'utf-8'
    rc = rc.text
    data = re.findall('"playstyles.%s.playstyle([0-9]+)": "(.+)"' % year, rc)
    playstyles = {}
    for i in data:
        playstyles[int(i[0])] = i[1]
    return playstyles

def main():
    year = 2023
    timeout = 5
    playstyles_dict = playstyles(year, timeout)
    print(playstyles_dict)

if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()
            ```

The code seems to have an error where the URL of the website is not mentioned in the code. The statement `messages_url = 'http://yourwebsite.com'` needs to be replaced with the URL of the website from which the playstyles are supposed to be extracted.

Apart from the above error, there aren't any obvious bugs in the code. However, the regular expression used in the code to extract playstyles for a given year might not work if the string format of the webpage changes.

Additionally, the variable `rc` is overwritten with its text value, which might be confusing.

Finally, the conditional statement at the end of the code, `if not (__name__ == '__main__')`, could be written as `if __name__ == '__main__'` to run the `main()` function when the script is executed directly, but not when it is imported as a module.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            














import requests
import re

def playstyles(year=2019, timeout=5):
    '''Return all playstyles in dict {id0: playstyle0, id1: playstyle1}.

    :params year: Year.
    '''
    messages_url = 'http://yourwebsite.com'
    rc = requests.get(messages_url, timeout=timeout)
    rc.encoding = 'utf-8'
    rc = rc.text
    data = re.findall('"playstyles.%s.playstyle([0-9]+)": "(.+)"' % year, rc)
    playstyles = {}
    for i in data:
        playstyles[int(i[0])] = i[1]
    return playstyles

def main():
    year = 2023
    timeout = 5
    playstyles_dict = playstyles(year, timeout)
    print(playstyles_dict)

if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()
            ```

The code has a bug in line 6 where the `messages_url` variable is set to `'http://yourwebsite.com'`, which is not a valid URL to fetch the playstyles.

Additionally, there is a possible bug in the regular expression `'"playstyles.%s.playstyle([0-9]+)": "(.+)"' % year` used to extract the playstyles. If the webpage's content is changed and the key format is modified or the quotation marks around the playstyle value change, this regular expression might not be able to extract the playstyles correctly. 

Finally, the conditional statement `if not (__name__ == '__main__')` used to call the `main()` function is incorrectly written. It should be `if __name__ == '__main__':` to check if the script is being run directly rather than imported as a module.
