Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            


















class UCIOutputCleaner:
    def cleanup(self, output):
        '''
        Generates consistent OpenWRT/LEDE UCI output
        '''
        
        output = output.replace('    ', '').replace(
            '\noption', '\n\toption').replace(
            '\nlist', '\n\tlist')
        
        output = output.replace('True', '1').replace(
            'False', '0')
        
        output = output.replace('\n\n\n', '\n\n')
        
        
        if not (output.endswith('\n\n')):
            return output[0:-1]
        return output

def main():
    sample_output = '\n    option some_value     True\n    option another_value  False\n    list  available_values\n\n\n    '
    
    
    
    
    
    
    cleaner = UCIOutputCleaner()
    cleaned_output = cleaner.cleanup(sample_output)
    print(cleaned_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

The code seems fine and there is no syntax error. However, there is a possibility of the following bugs:

1. `cleanup` method in `UCIOutputCleaner` class doesn't check if `output` parameter is `None`. If there is `None`, that will cause an error.

2. After replacing `'True'` and `'False'`, the resulting string is not checked properly. If `True` or `False` is part of some option or list value, those will also be converted to `1` and `0`.

3. `cleanup()` method checks if `output` ends with two newline characters and removes it. However, it does not check if `output` actually contains any characters before removing. If `output` is an empty string, that will cause an error.

4. There are white spaces before the docstring of the `cleanup` method which should be removed.

5. `list` and `option` strings are hard-coded in the `cleanup()` method.

6. There are several unnecessary empty lines in the sample output string.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            


















class UCIOutputCleaner:
    def cleanup(self, output):
        '''
        Generates consistent OpenWRT/LEDE UCI output
        '''
        
        output = output.replace('    ', '').replace(
            '\noption', '\n\toption').replace(
            '\nlist', '\n\tlist')
        
        output = output.replace('True', '1').replace(
            'False', '0')
        
        output = output.replace('\n\n\n', '\n\n')
        
        
        if not (output.endswith('\n\n')):
            return output[0:-1]
        return output

def main():
    sample_output = '\n    option some_value     True\n    option another_value  False\n    list  available_values\n\n\n    '
    
    
    
    
    
    
    cleaner = UCIOutputCleaner()
    cleaned_output = cleaner.cleanup(sample_output)
    print(cleaned_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

The code is trying to clean OpenWRT/LEDE UCI output, but it has some bugs, which include:

1. The `cleanup` method does not check whether the `output` parameter is `None` before performing string operations on it. An error will occur if `output` is `None`.

2. The `cleanup` method replaces 'True' and 'False' strings globally with '1' and '0', regardless of whether they are part of an option value or not. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. The `cleanup` method replaces three consecutive newline characters (`\n\n\n`) with two (`\n\n`), even if there are only two or one. This can result in extra newline characters.

4. The `cleanup` method checks if `output` ends with two consecutive newline characters (`\n\n`) and if so it truncates it by one character. However, if `output` is an empty string, or if it ends with only one newline character, this check will result in an error.

5. The `cleanup` method hard-codes the string values 'option' and 'list' which could have been passed in as variables.

6. There is a blank line after the docstring of the `cleanup` method, which is not required.
