Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            


















class UCIOutputCleaner:
    def cleanup(self, output):
        '''
        Generates consistent OpenWRT/LEDE UCI output
        '''
        
        output = output.replace('    ', '').replace(
            '\noption', '\n\toption').replace(
            '\nlist', '\n\tlist')
        
        output = output.replace('True', '1').replace(
            'False', '0')
        
        output = output.replace('\n\n\n', '\n\n')
        
        
        if output.endswith('\n\n'):
            return output[0:-1]
        return output

def main():
    sample_output = '\n    option some_value     True\n    option another_value  False\n    list  available_values\n\n\n    '
    
    
    
    
    
    
    cleaner = UCIOutputCleaner()
    cleaned_output = cleaner.cleanup(sample_output)
    print(cleaned_output)

if __name__ != '__main__':
    main()
            ```

The provided Python code is not fully consistent with good coding practices. However, the actual code logic is correct and does not appear to have any functional bugs.

With regard to the issues with the code, there are various formatting issues such as indentation problems and excessive whitespace that can make it hard to read the code and can lead to errors. Also, there are too many empty lines at the end of the code.

The class `UCIOutputCleaner` contains a method called `cleanup` which takes a string as input and removes any extra whitespace and replaces certain texts with their equivalent values The method then checks if the string ends with two consecutive newlines; if the condition is true, it removes one of the newlines. The method finally returns the output.

The main function uses a sample output string, generates a `UCIOutputCleaner` object, calls the `cleanup` method using the sample output string as input, and then prints the cleaned output to the console.

The code does not raise any syntax or runtime errors. Therefore, the code is not buggy.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            


















class UCIOutputCleaner:
    def cleanup(self, output):
        '''
        Generates consistent OpenWRT/LEDE UCI output
        '''
        
        output = output.replace('    ', '').replace(
            '\noption', '\n\toption').replace(
            '\nlist', '\n\tlist')
        
        output = output.replace('True', '1').replace(
            'False', '0')
        
        output = output.replace('\n\n\n', '\n\n')
        
        
        if output.endswith('\n\n'):
            return output[0:-1]
        return output

def main():
    sample_output = '\n    option some_value     True\n    option another_value  False\n    list  available_values\n\n\n    '
    
    
    
    
    
    
    cleaner = UCIOutputCleaner()
    cleaned_output = cleaner.cleanup(sample_output)
    print(cleaned_output)

if __name__ != '__main__':
    main()
            ```

I apologize as I made a mistake in my previous response. The provided Python code is not buggy and has no functional issues. The code logic and statements are correct and there are no syntax or runtime errors. The code just formats a string in a certain way. All steps in the code seem to be functional and working the way they are intended to work. Therefore, there are no statements involved in the bug and the code can be considered correct.
