Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            


















class UCIOutputCleaner:
    def cleanup(self, output):
        '''
        Generates consistent OpenWRT/LEDE UCI output
        '''
        
        output = output.replace('    ', '').replace(
            '\noption', '\n\toption').replace(
            '\nlist', '\n\tlist')
        
        output = output.replace('True', '1').replace(
            'False', '0')
        
        output = output.replace('\n\n\n', '\n\n')
        
        
        if output.endswith('\n\n'):
            return output[0:]
        return output

def main():
    sample_output = '\n    option some_value     True\n    option another_value  False\n    list  available_values\n\n\n    '
    
    
    
    
    
    
    cleaner = UCIOutputCleaner()
    cleaned_output = cleaner.cleanup(sample_output)
    print(cleaned_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

The code appears to be correct and functional. 

The code defines a class `UCIOutputCleaner` with one method called `cleanup`. The `cleanup` method takes a string as an input and performs some substitutions using the `replace` function. It replaces a series of whitespaces with empty string and prefixes it with "option" or "list". It also replaces "True" with "1" and "False" with "0". And it replaces any occurrence of more than 2 new lines with only 2 new lines.

The `main` function defines a sample output and instantiates the `UCIOutputCleaner` class. It calls the `cleanup` method of the class with the sample output as an argument and prints the resulting cleaned output.

There appear to be no syntactic or semantic errors in the code, and the intended functionality is achieved as expected.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            


















class UCIOutputCleaner:
    def cleanup(self, output):
        '''
        Generates consistent OpenWRT/LEDE UCI output
        '''
        
        output = output.replace('    ', '').replace(
            '\noption', '\n\toption').replace(
            '\nlist', '\n\tlist')
        
        output = output.replace('True', '1').replace(
            'False', '0')
        
        output = output.replace('\n\n\n', '\n\n')
        
        
        if output.endswith('\n\n'):
            return output[0:]
        return output

def main():
    sample_output = '\n    option some_value     True\n    option another_value  False\n    list  available_values\n\n\n    '
    
    
    
    
    
    
    cleaner = UCIOutputCleaner()
    cleaned_output = cleaner.cleanup(sample_output)
    print(cleaned_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Actually, the code appears to be correct and functional, and there are no obvious bugs in the code. 

The `UCIOutputCleaner` class defines a single method `cleanup`, which takes an input string as an argument, and performs a series of replacements on it to generate consistent OpenWRT/LEDE UCI output.

The `main` function creates a sample output and passes it to an instance of the `UCIOutputCleaner` class. It then calls the `cleanup` method of the class on the sample output, and prints the result.

The code seems to be performing as intended without any bugs. It is possible that there are some performance optimizations that could be made, but there are no syntax or logic errors that are immediately apparent.
