Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            def sanger_variants(self, institute_id=None, case_id=None):
    '''Return all variants with sanger information

        Args:
            institute_id(str)
            case_id(str)

        Returns:
            res(pymongo.Cursor): A Cursor with all variants with sanger activity
        '''
    query = {'validation': {'$exists': True}}
    if not institute_id:
        query['institute_id'] = institute_id
    if case_id:
        query['case_id'] = case_id
    
    return self.variant_collection.find(query)
            ```

Yes, the given Python code seems to have a logical error or a typo bug. 

The problem is on the below line of the code:

```python
if not institute_id:
        query['institute_id'] = institute_id
```

Here, the code should add the `institute_id` to the `query` dictionary only if `institute_id` is not equal to `None` (which is the case when the function is called like `sanger_variants(case_id="1234")`). 

But in the current implementation, this condition should be reversed, i.e. it should add `institute_id` to the query only if `institute_id` is not None. The correct implementation should be as follows:

```python
if institute_id:
        query['institute_id'] = institute_id
```

This would only add the `institute_id` to the query if `institute_id` is not `None`.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            def sanger_variants(self, institute_id=None, case_id=None):
    '''Return all variants with sanger information

        Args:
            institute_id(str)
            case_id(str)

        Returns:
            res(pymongo.Cursor): A Cursor with all variants with sanger activity
        '''
    query = {'validation': {'$exists': True}}
    if not institute_id:
        query['institute_id'] = institute_id
    if case_id:
        query['case_id'] = case_id
    
    return self.variant_collection.find(query)
            ```

Yes, there is a logical error in the given Python code. The mistake can be spotted in the following lines of code:

```python
if not institute_id:
    query['institute_id'] = institute_id
```

Here, the condition expression is checking if `institute_id` is False (e.g. `None`, `False`, `0`, `""`, and `[]`) and if the condition is True, the `institute_id` is added to the `query` dictionary. However, this is not correct because if `institute_id` is False, then it should not be added to the `query` dictionary.

To correct this error, the condition should be modified to the following:

```python
if institute_id is not None:
    query['institute_id'] = institute_id
```

In this case, the `institute_id` variable is added to the `query` dictionary only if it is not `None`.
