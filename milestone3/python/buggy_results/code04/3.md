Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            















import logging
import concurrent.futures


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        
        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
        self.tasks = {}
    
    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Add a task to the task list.'''
        future = self.executor.submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        task_id = id(future)
        self.tasks[task_id] = {'app_fu': future}
        return task_id
    
    def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        '''Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
        AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
        added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
        '''
        logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
        for task_id in self.tasks:
            
            
            fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
            if not (fut.done()):
                logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
                fut.exception()
        logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')



def main():
    task_manager = TaskManager()
    
    
    for i in range(10):
        task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))
    
    
    task_manager.wait_for_current_tasks()


if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()
            ```

Yes, the Python code is buggy. 

The method `fut.exception()` will raise the exception that occurred during the execution of `fut` rather than waiting for `fut` to complete. Therefore, statements after the call of `fut.exception()` will not be executed and tasks with an exception will be reported as completed.

To fix the bug the statement `fut.exception()` should be replaced with `fut.result()`. 

Also, there is an issue related to the `range` function. It needs to take two arguments `range(start, end)` instead of one `range(end)`. Therefore, the call of `task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))` should be replaced with `task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i),)`. 

Here is the correct code:

```python
import logging
import concurrent.futures

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
        self.tasks = {}

    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Add a task to the task list.'''
        future = self.executor.submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        task_id = id(future)
        self.tasks[task_id] = {'app_fu': future}
        return task_id

    def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        '''Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
        AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
        added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
        '''
        logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
        for task_id in self.tasks:
            fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
            if not fut.done():
                logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
                fut.result()
        logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')


def main():
    task_manager = TaskManager()
    for i in range(10):
        task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i),)
    task_manager.wait_for_current_tasks()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            















import logging
import concurrent.futures


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        
        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
        self.tasks = {}
    
    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Add a task to the task list.'''
        future = self.executor.submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        task_id = id(future)
        self.tasks[task_id] = {'app_fu': future}
        return task_id
    
    def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        '''Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
        AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
        added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
        '''
        logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
        for task_id in self.tasks:
            
            
            fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
            if not (fut.done()):
                logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
                fut.exception()
        logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')



def main():
    task_manager = TaskManager()
    
    
    for i in range(10):
        task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))
    
    
    task_manager.wait_for_current_tasks()


if not (__name__ == '__main__'):
    main()
            ```

Yes, the Python code is indeed buggy. 

The first statement involved in the bug is `task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))`. 

The `range()` function needs to take two arguments, for example `range(start, end)`, instead of one. Therefore, the call of `task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))` should be replaced with `task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i),)`.

The second statement involved in the bug is `fut.exception()`. 

The method `fut.exception()` will raise the exception that occurred during the execution of `fut` rather than waiting for `fut` to complete. Therefore, statements after the call of `fut.exception()` will not be executed and tasks with an exception will be reported as completed.

To fix the bug the statement `fut.exception()` should be replaced with `fut.result()`. 

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import logging
import concurrent.futures

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
        self.tasks = {}

    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Add a task to the task list.'''
        future = self.executor.submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        task_id = id(future)
        self.tasks[task_id] = {'app_fu': future}
        return task_id

    def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        '''Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
        AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
        added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
        '''
        logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
        for task_id in self.tasks:
            fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
            if not fut.done():
                logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
                fut.result()
        logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')


def main():
    task_manager = TaskManager()
    for i in range(10):
        task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i),)
    task_manager.wait_for_current_tasks()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
