Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            















import logging
import concurrent.futures


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        
        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
        self.tasks = {}
    
    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Add a task to the task list.'''
        future = self.executor.submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        task_id = id(future)
        self.tasks[task_id] = {'app_fu': future}
        return task_id
    
    def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        '''Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
        AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
        added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
        '''
        logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
        for task_id in self.tasks:
            
            
            fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
            if not ((not (fut.done()))):
                logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
                fut.exception()
        logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')



def main():
    task_manager = TaskManager()
    
    
    for i in range(10):
        task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))
    
    
    task_manager.wait_for_current_tasks()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, the Python code has bugs. The issue is with the task function 'sum' which is being called with a list of integers generated with the `range()` function. The Python `sum()` function expects an iterable, but `range()` returns a sequence. The `range()` function produces a sequence of numbers to give it to the `sum()` function. So we should cast the range to a list or use the '*' syntax to turn the iterable into arguments.

Here's the revised code with a fix:

```python
import logging
import concurrent.futures

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
        self.tasks = {}

    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        future = self.executor.submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        task_id = id(future)
        self.tasks[task_id] = {'app_fu': future}
        return task_id    

    def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
        for task_id in self.tasks:
            fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
            if not fut.done():
                logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
                fut.exception()
        logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')

def main():
    task_manager = TaskManager()
    for i in range(10):
        task_manager.add_task(sum, list(range(i)))
    task_manager.wait_for_current_tasks()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Now the code is modified to pass a list to sum() function, so that the code runs smoothly.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            















import logging
import concurrent.futures


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        
        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
        self.tasks = {}
    
    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Add a task to the task list.'''
        future = self.executor.submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        task_id = id(future)
        self.tasks[task_id] = {'app_fu': future}
        return task_id
    
    def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        '''Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
        AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
        added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
        '''
        logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
        for task_id in self.tasks:
            
            
            fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
            if not ((not (fut.done()))):
                logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
                fut.exception()
        logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')



def main():
    task_manager = TaskManager()
    
    
    for i in range(10):
        task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))
    
    
    task_manager.wait_for_current_tasks()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

The Python code has a bug in the add_task statement. It is calling the `sum` function with a range object which causes a TypeError in sum(). 

Specifically, the `range(i)` creates an iterator object of integers from 0 up to (but not including) i. But the `sum` function expects a list of numbers instead of an iterator object. So, we should convert the iterator object from range() to a list using `list(range(i))` before passing to `sum`. 

So the corrected statement should be:

```python
task_manager.add_task(sum, list(range(i)))
```

This will convert the range integer sequence into a list and properly sums it.
