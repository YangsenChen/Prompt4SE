Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            















import logging
import concurrent.futures


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        
        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
        self.tasks = {}
    
    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Add a task to the task list.'''
        future = self.executor.submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        task_id = id(future)
        self.tasks[task_id] = {'app_fu': future}
        return task_id
    
    def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        '''Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
        AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
        added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
        '''
        logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
        for task_id in self.tasks:
            
            
            fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
            if fut.done():
                logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
                fut.exception()
        logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')



def main():
    task_manager = TaskManager()
    
    
    for i in range(10):
        task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))
    
    
    task_manager.wait_for_current_tasks()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

There is a bug in the `wait_for_current_tasks()` method. When a task is done, the method calls `fut.exception()`, which raises an exception if the future has an exception set. Instead, the method should call `fut.result()`, which returns the result of the future (or raises an exception if the future has one set). Also, the method should remove tasks from the `self.tasks` dictionary after they are done. Here's how the method should look like:

```python
def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
    '''Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
    AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
    added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
    '''
    logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
    for task_id in list(self.tasks):  # Use a copy of the keys to avoid modifying the dictionary while iterating over it
        fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
        if fut.done():
            logger.debug('Task {} completed'.format(task_id))
            try:
                fut.result()  # Get the result of the future
            except Exception as e:
                logger.exception('Task {} raised an exception: {}'.format(task_id, e))
            del self.tasks[task_id]  # Remove the task from the dictionary
    logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')
```

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            















import logging
import concurrent.futures


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        
        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
        self.tasks = {}
    
    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Add a task to the task list.'''
        future = self.executor.submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        task_id = id(future)
        self.tasks[task_id] = {'app_fu': future}
        return task_id
    
    def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        '''Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
        AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
        added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
        '''
        logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
        for task_id in self.tasks:
            
            
            fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
            if fut.done():
                logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
                fut.exception()
        logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')



def main():
    task_manager = TaskManager()
    
    
    for i in range(10):
        task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))
    
    
    task_manager.wait_for_current_tasks()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, there is a bug in the `wait_for_current_tasks()` method. 

When a task is done, the method calls `fut.exception()`, which raises an exception if the future has an exception set. Instead, the method should use `fut.result()` to get the task's result or handle the exception using a try-except block. If an exception is raised, it should be logged with `logger.exception()`. 

Also, there is no code to remove completed tasks from the `self.tasks` dictionary, so it can accumulate completed tasks and cause a memory leak. The method should remove completed tasks from the task list by using the `del` operator on the dictionary. 

Here is a corrected version of the method:

```python
def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
    '''
    Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
    AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
    added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
    '''
    logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
    
    # Wait for all tasks to be completed
    for task_id, task in self.tasks.items():
        if task['app_fu'].done():
            try:
                logger.debug('Task {} completed with result: {}'.format(task_id, task['app_fu'].result()))
            except Exception as e:
                logger.exception('Task {} raised an exception: {}'.format(task_id, e))
            del self.tasks[task_id]
            
    logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')
```

This corrected version logs the task result upon completion and handles exceptions using a try-except block, logging the exception with `logger.exception()`. It also removes completed tasks from the `self.tasks` dictionary.
