Is the following Python code buggy? Try to reason the code first. The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc.
            ```python
            















import logging
import concurrent.futures


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        
        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
        self.tasks = {}
    
    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Add a task to the task list.'''
        future = self.executor.submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        task_id = id(future)
        self.tasks[task_id] = {'app_fu': future}
        return task_id
    
    def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        '''Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
        AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
        added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
        '''
        logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
        for task_id in self.tasks:
            
            
            fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
            if not (fut.done()):
                logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
                fut.exception()
        logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')



def main():
    task_manager = TaskManager()
    
    
    for i in range(10):
        task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))
    
    
    task_manager.wait_for_current_tasks()


if __name__ != '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, there are a few bugs in the provided Python code. Here are the bugs I found:

1. `if __name__ != '__main__':` should be changed to `if __name__ == '__main__':` to ensure the code inside the main function is actually called. As it stands, the main function is never executed because the conditional statement is always false.

2. `args` are passed as a single argument, a tuple of range(i), in the `main` function, instead of `(i,)`. We need to put a comma before the closing parenthesis to ensure that `args` is passed as a tuple.

3. In the `wait_for_current_tasks` method, when waiting for the future object, `fut.exception()` should be changed to `fut.result()`. `fut.exception()` does not wait for the future to complete, it only raises the exception that was set on the future if it exists.

4. The `range()` function only generates numbers up to, but not including, the specified argument. Therefore, we need to change the `range(i)` to `range(i+1)` in line 40 of the `main` function to ensure the sum is calculated correctly.

Apart from these, the code seems fine.

            Given the fact that the following Python code is buggy, Can you spot the statements involved in the bug? The bugs can be in different forms, for example, replaced arithmatic, replaced return value, replaced conditional boundary,etc. I care about the correctness.
            ```python
            















import logging
import concurrent.futures


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class TaskManager:
    def __init__(self):
        
        self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5)
        self.tasks = {}
    
    def add_task(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):
        '''Add a task to the task list.'''
        future = self.executor.submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)
        task_id = id(future)
        self.tasks[task_id] = {'app_fu': future}
        return task_id
    
    def wait_for_current_tasks(self):
        '''Waits for all tasks in the task list to be completed, by waiting for their
        AppFuture to be completed. This method will not necessarily wait for any tasks
        added after cleanup has started (such as data stageout?)
        '''
        logger.info('Waiting for all remaining tasks to complete')
        for task_id in self.tasks:
            
            
            fut = self.tasks[task_id]['app_fu']
            if not (fut.done()):
                logger.debug('Waiting for task {} to complete'.format(task_id))
                fut.exception()
        logger.info('All remaining tasks completed')



def main():
    task_manager = TaskManager()
    
    
    for i in range(10):
        task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))
    
    
    task_manager.wait_for_current_tasks()


if __name__ != '__main__':
    main()
            ```

Yes, there is a bug in the code, which is related to using the `sum` function with a `range` object.

In the `main` function, the following line of code:

```
task_manager.add_task(sum, range(i))
```

should be changed to:

```
task_manager.add_task(sum, range(0, i+1))
```

This is because the `range` function returns a sequence of numbers that starts from 0 by default. Therefore, if we pass `range(i)` in the `add_task` method, the first element of the sequence will be 0, which will be added to the other elements returned by `range(i)` and will cause the result to be off by 1.

By changing `range(i)` to `range(0, i+1)`, we ensure that the sequence starts from 0 and includes all numbers up to and including `i`. This will produce the correct result when passed to the `sum` function.
